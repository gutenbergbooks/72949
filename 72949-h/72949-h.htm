<p class='c008'>The great Epic Poets of Antiquity began with invoking superhuman aid
to their human powers. They magnified their subject by such a confession,
that their unassisted strength was unequal to worthily treating it; and it is
perfectly natural for us to believe that they were sincere in these implorations.
For their own belief was that Gods presided over, ruled, and directed,
not only the motions of the Visible Universe, and the greater and outward
events and destinies of nations and individuals, but that the Father of Gods
and Men, and peculiar Deities under him, influenced, inspired, and sustained,
gave and took away the powers of wisdom, virtue, and genius, in every kind
of design and in every kind of action.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SEWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>They would call down the help, suggestion, and inspiration of heavenly
guides, protectors, and monitors;—of Jupiter, to whom even their dim faith
looked above themselves and beyond this apparent world, for the incomprehensible
causes of things;—of Apollo, the God of Music and of Song;—of
those divine Sisters, under whose especial charge that imaginative religion
placed Poets and their works, the nine melodious Daughters of Memory;—of
those three other gentle deities, of whom Pindar affirms, that if there be
amongst men anything fair and admirable, to their gift it is owing, and whose
name expresses the accomplishing excellence of Poesy, if all suffrages are to be
united in praise: bright Sisters too, adored with altar and temple,—the Graces.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Milton, who had unremittingly studied the classical Art of Poetry, and
who brought into the service of his great and solemn undertaking all the
resources of poetical Art, which prior ages had placed at his disposal, whose
learning, from the literature of the world, gathered spoils to hang up in the
vast and glorious temple which he dedicated—He might, without offence to
the devout purpose of his own soul, borrow from the devotion of those old
pagan worshippers the hint, and partially the form, of those exordial supplications.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SEWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He opens the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> with Two Invocations. Both implore aid.
But the aid asked in one and in the other is different in kind, as the Two
Powers, of whom the aid is asked, are also wholly different. Let us look at
these two Invocations in the order in which they stand.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Of Man’s first disobedience, and the fruit</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought death into the world, and all our woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>With loss of Eden, till one greater Man</div>
      <div class='line'>Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing, heavenly Muse, that, on the sacred top</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire</div>
      <div class='line'>That shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the beginning how the heavens and earth</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose out of chaos: or, if Sion hill</div>
      <div class='line'>Delight thee more, and Siloa’s brook that flow’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Fast by the oracle of God; I thence</div>
      <div class='line'>Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,</div>
      <div class='line'>That with no middle flight intends to soar</div>
      <div class='line'>Above the Aonian mount, while it pursues</div>
      <div class='line'>Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer</div>
      <div class='line'>Before all temples the upright heart and pure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Instruct me, for Thou know’st: Thou from the first</div>
      <div class='line'>Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dove-like, sat’st brooding on the vast abyss,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mad’st it pregnant: what in me is dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>Illumine: what is low, raise and support;</div>
      <div class='line'>That to the height of this great argument</div>
      <div class='line'>I may assert eternal Providence,</div>
      <div class='line'>And justify the ways of God to men.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The First is taken, hint and form both, from Homer. Homer, girding up
his strength to sing the war of confederated Greece against Troy and her
confederates, makes over his own overpowering theme to a Spirit able to
support the burden—to the Muse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sing, Goddess, he begins, the Anger of Achilles.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Even so Milton. After proposing in a few words the great argument of
his Poem—that fatal first act of disobedience to the Creator, by which our
First Parents, along with His favour, forfeited Innocence, Bliss, Immortality,
and Paradise, for themselves and their posterity, until the coming of the
Saviour shall redeem the Sin and loss—he devolves his own task upon a
Muse, whom he deems far higher than the Muse of his greatest predecessor,
and whom he, to mark this superiority, addresses as the <em>Heavenly Muse</em>.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>She is the Muse who inspired on the summit now of Horeb, now of Sinai;
when for forty years in retreat from his own people, yet under their Egyptian
yoke, he kept the flocks of his father-in-law Jethro—the actual Shepherd
who, from communing with God and commissioned by God, came down into
Egypt again to be the Shepherd of his people and to lead out the flock of
Israel.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SEWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>She is the Muse who, when the Hebrew tribes were at length seated in the
promised land—when Zion in the stead of Sinai was the chosen Mountain of
God—inspired Psalmists and Prophets.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And the reason is manifest for the distinguishing of Moses. For all critics
of the style of the inspired Writers distinguish that of Moses from all the
others, as antique, austere, grave, sublime, as if there were in him who conversed
personally with God greater sanctity of style, even as his face shone
when he came down from the Mount; as the whole character and office of
Moses was held by the Hebrews, and is held, perhaps, by us, as lifting him
above all other prophetic leaders.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He was the founder of the Nation, and the type of the Saviour.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Milton desires for his work, all qualities of style, as the variable subject
shall require them. Not only the high rank of Moses as the author of the
Pentateuch required that he should be named, but this in particular, that
Moses was the historian of the Creation and Fall.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>One might for a moment be tempted to confound the inspiration here
meant with that highest inspiration which was vouchsafed in those holy
places, and which we distinguish by the unequivocal name of revelation.
But on reflection we perceive it not possible that Milton should have
ascribed such an office to an Impersonation—those awful Communications
which distinguished those persons chosen by the Almighty to be the vessels
of his Will to the Children of Men. His revelations, we are instructed to
believe, are immediately from himself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Somebody said to me once that Milton’s First Invocation to the Muse is
oppressed with Mountains; that it is as if he had shaken out what he had
got under the head Mountains, in his Common-Place Book; and—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Somebody had better have held his tongue. No. They occur by natural
association. He wants aid of the Muse who inspired Moses—I suppose, who
sustained—that is, gave his style—of the other writers in the Old Testament.
To suppose her visiting Moses on either peak of the Sacred Hill where he
had his divine communions, is obvious and inevitable, and, I hope, solemn
and sublime too. To suppose her accompanying the migration of the
Israelites, and as she had devoutly affected their Sacred Mountain of the
Wilderness, also devoutly affecting their Holy Mountain at the foot of which
they built their Metropolis, is a spontaneous and unavoidable process of
thought. Sinai and Sion represent, as if they contain embodied, the religion
and history blended of the race. And if the divine Muse has two
divine Hills, how can Milton help thinking of the quasi-divine Hill on which
were gathered the nine quasi-divine Sisters? Doubtless, three distinct
Mountains in the first sixteen lines, if absolutely considered, may seem
cumbrous and overwhelming. But accept them for what they are in the
Invocation; the two first localisings of the one Muse, they are easy. Why
should not her wing skim from peak to peak? and Parnassus looms in the
distance on the horizon.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SEWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A more urgent and trying question is, <em>what</em> does he invoke? We have a
sort of biographical information respecting the Address to the Spirit. Milton
did believe himself under its especial influences, and the Address is a direct
and proper Prayer. But <em>what</em> is this Muse? To us the old Muses—whatever
they may have been to the Greeks—are Impersonations, and nothing more,
of powers in our own souls. If name attest nature, such is the muse of
Milton—a power of his own soul—but one which dwelt also in the soul of the
great Hebrew shepherd. Say, for the sake of a determining notion, the power
of the austere and simple religious sublime. A human power, but moved by
contact of the soul with divine subjects. Perhaps I say too bluntly that those
old Muses were mostly but impersonations of human powers. An abstruse,
difficult, and solemn part of our existence is touched, implicated. We find
when we are deeply moved that powers which slept in us awake;—Powers
which have before awaked, and fallen back in sleep;—Powers, too, that have
never before awaked.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But what do we know of what is ultimate? If there is a contact of
our spirits with the universal Spirit, if there are to us divine communions,
influences, how do we know when they begin and end? It <em>seems</em> reverent
and circumspect to view poetical inspiration as a human fact only,
but we are not sure that it is not even more religious to believe that the unsuspected
breath of Deity moves our souls in their higher and happier moments.
Be they motions of our own souls, be there inferior influences mingled, those
Muses were names for the powers upon this view—for the powers and
mingled influences upon another. On the whole, I think that the distinction
is here intended generally; and that the heavenly Muse represents the human
soul exalted, or its powers ennobled by contact with illuminating and hidden
influences—as the prophets Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, have each quite the
style of their own humanity in writing under the governance of the Spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>I consider the free daring with which all Poets of the modern world, at
least, have, for the uses of their Art, converted Powers and Agencies into
imaginary beings. I consider the respects in which the Poet has need of
aid. He wants aid if he is to penetrate into regions inaccessible to mortal
foot or eye—if he is to disclose transactions veiled since the foundations of
the world; but this aid the Muse cannot afford to the <em>Christian</em> Poet, and we
shall presently see that he applies for it to a higher Source. But the Poet
who undertakes to sing of Heaven and Earth, of Chaos and of Hell, who
comprehends within his unbounded Song all orders of Being, from the Highest
and Greatest to the Lowest and Least—all that are Good and all that are
Evil, and all that are mixed of Good and Evil—and all transactions from the
date, if we may safely so speak, when Time issued from the bosom of Eternity
to the still distant date, when Time shall again merge in that Eternity out
of which it arose, and be no more:—That Poet, if any, needs implore for a
voice equal to his theme, a power of wing measured to the flight which he
intends to soar; he needs for the very manner of representation which he is
to use—for the very words in which he is to couch stupendous thoughts—for
the very music in which his pealing words shall roll—aid, if aid can be had for
supplication.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, Seward. We consider these things. We consider the laborious,
learned, and solemn studies, by which we are told, by which Milton tells us,
that he endeavoured to qualify himself for performing his great work, and I
propose this account of this first Invocation, stripped of its Poetical garb.
In the first place, that the subject of desire to the Poet—the thing asked—is
high, grave, reverend, sublime, fitted Style or Expression. As for the
addressing, and the power of the wish, you may remember that, as we
hear, employing human means, he assiduously read, or caused to be read,
the profane, and his native, and the Sacred Writers—drawing thence his
manner of poetical speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Heavenly</em>” Muse is opposed to “<em>Olympian</em>” Muse; as if “<em>Hebraic</em>” to
“<em>Hellenic</em>;” as if “Scriptural” to “Classical;” as if “<em>Sacred</em>” to “<em>Profane</em>;”
as if Muse of Zion to Muse of Pindus. Therefore we must ask—What
“<em>Muse</em>” ordinarily means? We know what it meant in the mouth of a
believing Greek. It meant a <em>real person</em>—a divine being of a lower Order.
But Milton is a Christian—for whom those deities are no more. <em>They</em> are,
in his eye, mere imaginations—air.</p>

<p class='c008'>We must ask—What does, in ordinary Verse, not in sacred poetry, a
Christian poet mean, when He names, and yet more when he invokes, the
Muse—the Sacred Sisters nine? And we are thrown upon recognising the
widely-spread literary fact—not unattractive or quite unimportant—that
Christendom cherished this reminiscence of Heathendom; that, in fact, our
poetry seems to rest for a part of its life upon this airy relic of a fled mythology—varied
in all ways, Muse, Helicon, Hippocrene, &#38;c. Greatest Poets,
not poetasters, the inspired, not the imitative and servile—and at height of

<p class='c010'>I put these together, because I doubt not but that Milton in <em>choosing</em> and
<em>guarding</em> (just like Tasso) the word, looked this practice of Christian, or
christened poets, full in the face; and spoke, founding upon it. Muse, to his
mind <em>inventing</em> his Invocation, had three senses. Imaginary Deity of a departed
belief—An Authoritative Name, thence retained with affection and
pride by Poets of the Christian world—Or, something new, which might be
made for his own peculiar purpose, or which Tasso had begun to make,
undertaking a Poem after a sort sacred.</p>

<p class='c008'>I cannot believe that the word which has held such fond place in the minds
of great poets, and all poets, can have been a dry and bald imitation of antiquity.
Doubtless it had, and has, a living meaning; answers to, and is

<p class='c008'>Our attention is first reflectively directed upon recognised Impersonations
<em>in Poetry</em>. But we are very much accustomed to misunderstand the nature
of Poetry; for we are much accustomed to look upon Poetry as an art of
intellectual recreation, and nothing more. Only as a privileged Art—an
Art privileged to think in a way of its own, and to entertain, for the sake of
a delicate amusement and gratification, illusory thoughts which have never
had belief belonging to them. And meeting with Impersonations in poetry,
we set down Impersonations amongst the illusory thoughts thus imagined and
entertained for intellectual pleasure, and which have never been believed. It
is a mistake altogether. Poetry has its foundation in a transient belief.
Impersonations have held very durable belief amongst men. When we
reflect and take upon us to become cognisant of our own intellectual acts, we
are bound to become cognisant of these illusions—to know that they must
have temporary belief—that they must not have permanent belief.</p>

transplanting from a Pagan Mythology into a Christian Poem, and thus

<p class='c008'>The Seventh Book again opens with an Invocation for aid, and again

      <div class='line'>Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play</div>
      <div class='line'>In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased</div>
      <div class='line'>With thy celestial song.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>She is now named—<em>Urania</em>. (The former title given her—“<em>Heavenly
Muse</em>”—is equivalent.) But because one of the Nine Muses was named
Urania, he distinguishes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The <em>meaning</em>, not <em>the name</em>, I call.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>She is described as conversing before the creation of this Universe, and
playing with her Sister Wisdom, in the presence of God, who listens, pleased,
to her song.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this bold and tender twofold Impersonation, I seem to understand this.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Wisdom</em> is the Thought of God respectively to the connection of Causes
and Effects in his Creation, or to the Laws which constitute and uphold its
Order: considered as Useful.</p>

<p class='c008'>This Thought is boldly separated from God, and impersonated as One
Sister.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Urania</em> is the Thought of God, relatively to the Order and Harmony of his
Works:—considered as Beautiful.</p>

<p class='c008'>When God sees that his Creation upon each day is “good,” (which
expression Milton is careful to repeat upon each day,) we must understand
that he regards it in <em>both</em> respects.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Invocation is, therefore, placed with a perfect propriety at the beginning
of the Book which is occupied in describing the Creation.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the meaning here attributed to Urania <em>playing</em> with Wisdom before
the pleased Father, compare the passage where the dance of the Angels has
been compared to the motions of the stars, and the Speaker, the Archangel
Raphael, adds:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And in their motions harmony divine</div>
      <div class='line'>So smooths her charming tones, that God’s own ear</div>
      <div class='line'>Listens delighted.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Where the audible harmony of the spheres and the song of Urania seem to
be as nearly as possible one and the same thing—namely, Music—which is
The Beautiful in one of its kinds, used, with extremely profound and bold
imagination, for expressing The Beautiful in all its kinds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who is it that, in presence of the Everlasting Throne, converses with her
sister, Eternal Wisdom; plays with her—singing, the while, so that the
awful Ear of Omnipotence bends from the Throne, listening and pleased?</p>

<p class='c008'>The majestical Invocation opens the Seventh Book of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>;
and the Seventh Book of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> is occupied from beginning to end
in amplifying, with wonderful plenitude, exactness, beauty, and magnificence
of description, the First Chapter in the Book of Genesis. In other words
the Seventh Book of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> describes the Week of Creation—the six
days of God’s working, and the seventh of His rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Milton moulds, at the height of poetical power, into poetical form thoughts
that are universal to the Spirit of Man. What then, we must ask, are the
two Thoughts that rise in the Spirit of Man, looking with its awakened and
instructed faculties upon the Universe of God? Assuredly one is, wonder at
the adaptation of Means to Ends—that fitness of which all human Science
is nothing but the progressive, inexhaustible revelation. This is that
Eternal Wisdom, whom the Poet daringly finds a distinct inhabitant of the
Empyrean. The other thought, insuppressibly arising upon the same contemplation,
is, wonder of the overwhelming beauty that overflows the visible creation.
This is the <em>Heavenly Muse, Urania</em>. The purpose of the Divine Mind
to create the Useful Order of Things is impersonated as <em>Eternal Wisdom</em>.
The purpose of the Divine Mind to create the Beauty of Things is impersonated
under a name which the Poet boldly and reverently supplies. Milton’s
description of the six days completely displays the two notions: it impresses
the notion of Useful Order and Beauty.</p>

exalted by expressly religious contemplations and communions—in Moses by
converse with God face to face, as a man with his friend. You remember

ordinarily has been understood in the Protestant Church, if less than enthusiasts

Human Sense of Beauty fashioned to the uttermost, hallowed by the nearest
approaches to the Deity that are permitted to the individual human person
who happens to be in question, but who must be understood as one living
under the revelation of the true God. In strictness of speech, Heavenly Muse

<p class='c008'>Yes—from the bold nature of Impersonation, which comprehends always a
<em>variable</em> thought. For Imagination blends and comprehends rather than
it severs and excludes. It delights in conceiving that as another manner
of acting in some imaginary being which the analytical understanding
would class as a distinct metaphysical faculty. It delights in unity of creation;
and, having created, in bestowing power, and in accumulating power
on its creature. I have heard people say that Collins, in speaking of
Danger—</p>

<p class='c008'>Might one word, my dear sir, be dropped in, purporting or reminding, that
the Beautiful, or Beauty, is here used, with its most capacious meaning, to
comprehend many other qualities distinct from the Beautiful taken in its
narrowest acceptation among critics. For example, the solemn, the sublime,
and many other qualities are included, that are distinct from the Beautiful,
taken in the mere sense that critics have attached to it; all such qualities
agreeing in this, that they affect the mind suddenly, and without time given
for reflection, and that they appear as a glory poured over objects as over the
natural universe. The large sense of the term Beauty belongs to a perfectly
legitimate use of language—a use at once high and popular; as every one
feels that the beauty of creation includes whatever affects us with irreflective
admiration—appears as a glory—stupendous forests—mountains—rivers—the
solemn, boundless munificence of the starry firmament. Milton says there is
terror in Beauty—and we may say there is a beauty in terror.</p>

You may go on to examining the Poem well prepared; for you now
know in what Spirit of thought it was entered upon and composed, and in
what Spirit of thought you must engage in, and carry through, the examination
of the Poem. You can understand that Milton, sanctified in Will by
a dedicated life—intellectually armed and accomplished by the highest
mere human learning, as a Scholar, as a Thinker, as a Master of his own
sublime and beautiful Art—enriched by more solemn studies, whether of
God’s written word or of its devout and powerful expounders, with all the
knowledge, especially claimed by his task, which a Mind, capacious, profound,
retentive, indefatigable, could bring to the celebration of this most
stupendous theme;—finally, led—as he, in all reverence, believed himself,—upheld,
and enlightened by the Spirit of supernal grace, prayed for and
vouchsafed;—that He, coming,—by nature and by nurture such and so fitted,—to
relate anew and at large—and as if He, the Poet, were himself enfolded
with the garb of a Prophet,—as if He were himself commissioned from on
High, and charged with a second, a more explicit and copious, an ampler
and more unbosoming revelation,—<em>that History</em>, full of creating Love and
provoked Wrath,—full of zeal and loyal truth, in pure angelical creatures,
and of hateful revolt—full, in the lower creature, Man, at first of gracious
and ineffable glory and bliss, and native immortality, then of lamentable
dishonour, sin and misery, and death—You can readily conceive that Milton
approaching to begin this Work, to which alone the desires, to which alone
the labours, to which alone the consecration of his genius looked—that he,
indeed, felt in his now near, in his now reached undertaking, a burthen overwhelming
to his mortal strength; and that his prayer, put up for support, rose
indeed from his lips as men pray who are overtaken with some sharp fear
and sore constraint.</p>

the Human Spirit has never felt called upon to impose upon itself. On
the contrary, the most religious Minds have always felt themselves required
in duty to dedicate their best faculties of reason to the service of religion—by
inquiring into, and expounding, the truths of religion. But Reason is
not the sole intellectual power that God has given to Man, nor the sole
faculty by the use of which he will be glorified. Another power native to
the same spirit, granted to it now in more scant and now in overflowing
measure, is the faculty of verse and of poetical creation; and it is no more
conceivable that we are bound to withhold the efforts of this power from its
highest avocations, than that we are under obligation to forbear from carrying

<p class='c008'>Accordingly, in this great poem, the name Heaven continually meets us as
designating the blissful abode where the Omnipresent God is imagined as
from eternity locally dwelling in light uncreated—the unapproachable splendour
of his own effulgence. There, the Assessor of his throne, the Divine Son,
sits “in bliss embosomed.” And there, created inhabitants, are the innumerable
host of happy Angels. At first, all—whilst all stand upright—and
until the sin of Satan casts out one third part of the number. The Imagination
of the poet supposes a resemblance to Earth; for beauty and delight—hills,
rocks, vales, rivers and fountains, trees and Elysian flowers. Although
he endeavours to dilate the fancy of his reader in speaking of Heaven with
conceptions of immense extent, it is a limited, not a boundless, Heaven; for
it is conceived as resting upon a base or firmament, and as being enclosed
with crystalline walls. Palaces and towers, which the angels have built,
are spoken of in Heaven.</p>

<p class='c008'>The course of the Poem sometimes leads us into <span class='sc'>Chaos</span>. We are to
imagine an infinite abyss of darkness, in which the formless embryons and
elements of things toss and war in everlasting uproar. A Ruler and other
spirits of darkness will be found dwelling there. Here height, breadth, and
time and place are lost. But the tremendous gulf is permeable to the wings
of angels. A more important seat of the transaction to which we shall be introduced
is, “the place of evil,” made, after the rebellion of the Angels, their
habitation and place of punishment—“the house of wo and pain”—<span class='sc'>Hell</span>.
It is described as having various regions—fiery and frozen; hideous mountains,
valleys, and caves. Five rivers, named and characterised from those
that flow through the Hell of classical antiquity—and, in particular, a boiling
Ocean, into which the rebel Angels are supposed to fall. Notwithstanding the
flames, a heavy gloom prevails throughout. It is immensely extended, but
has a solid ground—“a dungeon horrible,” walled and overvaulted. The
whole of the Fallen Angels are at first imprisoned in Hell. But they escape.
Hell has Gates kept by Sin and her Son Death. The Fallen Angels build in
Hell a palace and city called Pandemonium. Hell is situated in the lowest
depth of Chaos, out of which it has been taken.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>This Visible Universe</em> is represented as built subsequently to, and consequently
upon, the Fall of the Angels. You are to imagine this Earth of ours,
the Moon, the Sun, the planets, the fixed stars, and the Milky Way—all that
sight can reach—as enclosed in a hollow sphere: that is, firmly compacted.
Satan alights upon its outside, and walks about it: and it serves to defend
this enclosed visible Universe from the inroads of Chaos and primeval darkness.
On the Earth, created in all the variety that we behold in it, excepting
that the climates are all happy, our Two first Parents live in the Garden of
Paradise, planted by God. The unimaginably vast enclosing Sphere hangs
by a golden chain from the battlements of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, sir, Poetry represents:—</p>

High and Low in space have a moral meaning. So <em>ocular</em> light and darkness.

and speaks with a voice. The Eternal Eye sees, the Eternal Ear hears. He
sits, invisible through brightness, on a Throne.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is remarkable that Poetry, which above all human discourse calls out
into our Consciousness the Divinity that stirs within us, at the same time
casts itself with delight into the Corporeal Senses, as if the two Extremes
met, or that either balanced the others. We see a reason in this. Passion
cleaves to the perceptions of the Senses. Upon these impressions Imagination

<p class='c008'>But there is a more comprehensive view. The Mind in the treatment of
its Knowledge ranges between two Extremes. It receives the original givings
of Experience, at the utmost particularised and individualised, determined
under conditions of time, Place, Individuals. It reduces individuals into
Kinds, actions into Laws, finds Principles, unveils Essences. These are the
ultimate findings of Reason. The Philosophical Mind tends to these—dwells
in these—is at home in these—is impatient of its knowledge whilst unreduced.
This is the completed victory of Intelligence over its data. It is by Comprehension
and Resolution the Reduction of Multitude into Unity. At the same
time, the Mind leaves the turbulent element of Sense, and passes into a
serene air, a steadfast and bright and cold sky. Now, then, Poetry dwells
or makes a show of dwelling at the other extreme—in the forms as they were
given. What semblance, what deception, may be in this, is another question.
But this is her ostentation. She imitates to a deception, if she does not
copy these original givings. She represents Experience, and this she does
for the sake of the Power of Affection which attends the forms of Experience.
For the most part these original givings are involved in sensible perceptions,
Eye, Ear, Hand, and beating heart. How will you escape from them? Eye,
above all, the reigning faculty of communing with Earth and Sky. So as
that he who is shut out from the world of sight, seems to us to be shut out
from the world; but he who is shut out from the world of Sound: not equally

<p class='c008'>Nothing new. We are warranted by universal human experience in
assuming it as a psychological fact, that we are formed with a disposition
irresistibly carrying us to see in things out of ourselves, <em>ourselves reflected</em>—in
things that are without life, will, and intelligence, we conceive life, will,
and intelligence; and, when the law of a stronger illusion swaying our faculties
constrains us to bestow an animated form, we bestow our own. By
these two intellectual processes, which in one way or another are familiar to
our experience, but which seem strange when we reflect upon them, and try
to understand them, we make human-shaped Impersonations of inanimate
things, and of abstract notions! If we would know the magnitude of the
dominion which this disposition constraining us thus to Impersonate has
exercised over the human mind, we must go back into those ages of the
world when this disposition exerted itself, uncontrolled by philosophy, and in
obedience to religious impulses, when Impersonations of inanimate Objects
and Powers, of Moral Powers, and of notions formed by the understanding,
filled the Temples of the nations with visible Deities, and were worshipped
with altars and incense, hymns and sacrifice.</p>

cleansed the understanding from illusion, and observe how tenaciously these
imaginary beings, with imaginary life, hold their place in our Sculpture,
Painting, Poetry, and Eloquence; nay, and in our quiet and common speech;
and if we should venture to expatiate in the walks of the profounder emotions,
we shall sometimes be startled with the sudden apparition of boldly-impersonated

<p class='c008'>It is, as you say, strongly connected with this disposition in the human
mind, to produce—and believe in Power in external nature—Nymphs, Genii,
Fairies, Neptune, Vulcan, Apollo, and every belief in mythology. This disposition
is, the moment it sees effects which strongly affect it, to embody upon
the spot the cause or power which produced them. In doing this in the old unenlightened
world, it filled Nature with Deities, and not Nature only, but the
human mind and life. Love was a Deity; Fear and Anger were; Remorse
was in the Furies; Memory was Mnemosyne; Wisdom was in Pallas; Fortune
was, and Ate; and Necessity and Death were Deities.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>What question? If they are meant as <em>real</em>, though not Impersonations of
the Poet, they were Impersonations of the human mind from an earlier and
more believing time. Whether they were simply and purely from human
feeling, in the bosom of human society, or were framed for the belief of others
by the skilful artificers of belief, is not of positive moment as to the evidence
to the operations and dispositions of the human mind. Those who presided
over the national life of every religion might deliberately contrive, and might
deliver over to the credence of their nation, imaginary powers, conceived with
inventive imagination, as a Poet conceives them. But the very inventions,
and still more the simple faith that received the inventions, show the intellectual
disposition to embody in living powers the causes of effects. The faith
of the people shows further the disposition and ability of the human mind to
attribute reality, and that by force of feeling, to the creations of its own
intellect, and particularly its aptitude to cleave to those creations in which it
embodies power of which it strongly feels the effects. But I would rather
believe that such faith has often formed itself in the bosom of simple societies
without devisers—that men have conceived and felt till they believed; that
they felt delight and beauty in a gushing fountain till they believed in a presiding
spirit as fair—that the sun, the giver of light and warmth, of the day
and of the year, could not appear to them a mere star of day, a larger, brighter
fire. They felt a gift in his rays, and in their influence, and deified the
visible orb. They thought of—they saw the terrors of war, and believed that
some Power delighting in blood stirred up the hearts of men to mutual
destruction.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If those ancient poets in whom this mythology remains, are to be received
sometimes as delivering known and accepted names as beings, sometimes as
supplying from their momentary inventions unreceived names, then this view
of the case also affords proof of the same disposition we have spoken of. It
shows the disposition of men to believe in powers the immediate causes of
impressive effects; and the Poet must be conceived as suggesting and delivering
the shape and name of Powers which it is already believed must be,
though themselves are not known—not as inventing them deliberately and
ornamentally, nor as declaring them from an assured and assumed knowledge.
This disposition to produce shapes of powers which in early ages is attended
with positive belief, afterwards remains in imagination—art, though not
extinct in the work of our mind for dealing in realities. Do we, sir, ever
divest ourselves of a belief in Death, Chance, Fate, Time? But a strong
belief overrules with us all such illusions of fancy, withdrawing all power
to the great source of power. Therefore, such a disposition, though it continues,
is in real thought much oppressed and stifled, and shows itself almost
accidentally, as it were, rather than in any constant opinion, for in deliberate
opinion it cannot hold. But in Poetry, even in Eloquence, it remains. There
we allow ourselves in illusion; and the mind leaps up with a sort of rejoicing,
to recover its old liberty of deceiving itself with splendid fictions.</p>

  </div>

<p class='c008'>Which is again an instance of the two different forms in which Imagination
is seen in the earlier and later age—in the first, realised in belief—in the
last, having its domain in the avowedly ideal world of Poetry.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I confess, my dear friends, it appears to me not easy to explain how the
mind is enabled, desire it as much as it will, to pour its own capacities into
insensate things. When Lear says, “Nature, hear! dear Goddess, hear!”
his passion will not believe but that there is a hearer and executor of its
curse; and it imagines nature capable of hearing. “If prayers can pierce
the clouds and enter heaven, why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick
curses.” Does not all Passion that addresses itself to inanimate objects
throw into them a feeling? Would not the Invocation be idle to the unresponsive
and unhearing? This, then, is the nature of human passion, that,
when vehement, it cannot conceive that its will is not to be fulfilled. If there
are no adequate ministers, inadequate ministers must take their place. Inanimate
things must become agents. “Rise, rise, ye wild tempests, and
cover his flight.”—“Strike her young bones, ye taking airs, with lameness.”
This is one demand, then, of passion, the execution of its purposes. Another
demand of passion is sympathy. This, we know, is one of its first and
strongest demands. If, then, men will not, or are not present to sympathise,
that which surrounds must. The boiling passion finds it easier to believe
that winds and rocks feel with it, than that it is sole, and cut off from all
participation. Hence the more exuberant passion animates things, our own
gladness animates nature.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SEWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And how well has Adam Smith said how our sympathy includes the dead!
Of all that feel not, it may with the readiest illusion embrace those who once
felt; and what do we <em>know</em> that they do not yet feel? Now, if this can be
granted as the nature and power of passion, that, without any better ground
than its own uncontrollable efflux, it can blend itself into that which is
around it—that it believes lightnings and floods will destroy, merely from the
intensity of will with which it wills them to destroy—though here the fitness
for destruction is a reason; but if it imagines that, undestroying, they will rise
to destroy, that peace shall be converted into danger, and sleep into anguish,
that food shall not nourish, and winds shall not waft, rather than it shall be
left without vengeance, or baffled; then may we say that there is in Passion
an absolute power of carrying itself out into other existence, and that no
other condition, in such existence, is necessary, save that it shall become
<em>obviam</em> to passion in its mood. If so, then, of course, any reason from analogy
or causation becomes a very potent one to attract such passion and opinions
formed by passion. Let this be established in passion at its fiercest, wildest
height, and the principle is obtained. It is then the disposition of the mind
under emotion to diffuse its emotion, bending the things around to suit its purposes,
or at least filling them with sympathy with itself. In either case,
upon this reason, that only so can the will which rises with its emotion ever
be satisfied. This principle given, strongest in strongest passion, but accompanying
all emotion, is the root of Impersonation. All intellectual analogies,
all coincidences of reality with the demands of emotion, will quicken and facilitate
this act of the mind; but neither analogies nor coincidences, nor
any other inclining reasons, are requisite. The emotion will reconcile and
assimilate any object to itself, if it is reduced to them. Here then is a
principle sufficient to animate all nature, all being, and to any extent or
height. This seems to be the foundation of Impersonation—that it is the
nature of man to fill all things with himself. It is plainly a radix for all
poetical Impersonation. He makes and reads everywhere reflection of
mind; he does this without passion, that is, not without feeling—for in all
ordinary thought there is feeling—but without transported passion. His
strong passions in their transport show us in plainer evidence how he
involves all things with himself, and subjects all things to himself; and
his gentler feelings do the same. He is almost the cause of a world of mind
revolving round and upon himself—he makes himself such a centre; this is
the constant temper and the habitual mode of conceiving and hearing of
all minds.</p>

pleasure, the Sublime, the Beautiful, the poetically wild or solemn, does not
exist. All other ingredients, if pleasure be absent, leave the compound
imperfect—the thing undone. Therefore Addison says boldly, the pleasure
of Imagination, whom Akenside follows. But further, Talboys—I believe
that in Imagination poetical, there is always—or almost always—Illusion. I
cannot get it out of my head as a main element. In its splendour, this is
past doubt—in Impersonation—Apostrophe to the dead, or absent, or unborn—Belief
is in the power of your curses—seeing the past or future as present;
and in the whole fiction of Epos or Drama, the semi-belief in the life and
reality of the feigned personages.</p>

<p class='c008'>In natural passion, gentlemen, the Illusion reigns unchecked. In the
workings of poetical imagination the Illusion is tempered and ruled, subdued
under a Law, conformed to conditions and requisitions of art. Men resist the
doctrine of Illusion. They dislike to know to what an immense extent they
are subject to Illusions. I have no conception of Beauty or Sublimity that
does not require, for effecting it, some transfusion of life and spirit from our

obtruded upon him—denies them—revolts from them. To restore the belief
and faith in Imagination, and to demonstrate its worth, is an enterprise obligatory
on philosophy. The world seems returning to it, for a while having
abhorred it. Our later poets have seen both Cause and Effect. Do you believe
that thinking a child like a flower does not increase your tenderness for
him or her, and that the innocence of the flower does not quicken and

<p class='c008'>No metaphysician has ever, that I have read, expounded belief. Has
Hartley? This quasi-belief, or half-belief, against better knowledge, must
be admitted as a sure fact or phenomenon.  I don’t care how hard it
may be to persuade anybody to believe as the foundation of a philosophy an
absurdity, or self-contradictory proposition, “That you believe to be true,
that which you know to be false.” There the fact is; and without it you
build your house in the air—off the ground. Soften it—explain it. Say that
you know for one moment, and in the next know the contrary. Say that you
<em>lean to belief</em>—that it is an impression, half-formed—imperfect belief—a state
of mind that has partaken of the nature of belief—that it is an impression resembling
belief—operating partial effects of belief. But unquestionably, no
man, woman, or child has read a romance of Scott or Bulwer or Dickens, without
seeing their actions and sufferings with his soul, in a way that, if his soul
be honest, and can simply tell its own suffering, must by it be described as a
sort of momentary belief. What are the grief, the tears, the joy, the hope,
the fear, the love, the admiration, and half-worship—the vexation, the hate,
the indignation, the scorn, the gratitude, yea, and the thirst of revenge—if the
pageant floats by, and stirs actually to belief? The supposition is an impossibility,
and the theory lies on our side, and not on Johnson’s, who has
nothing for him but a whim of rationalism. I take novels—because in them
it is a common proof, though this species be the less noble. But take Epos
from the beginning. Take Tragedy—take Comedy—and what is, was, or will
it be, but a half-unsubstantial image of reality, waited upon by a half-substantial
image of belief, the fainter echo of airy harps? My drift is, that

<p class='c008'>I see in Imagination a power which I can express to my own satisfaction
by two terms, of which you, Seward, sometimes look as if you refused me
the use, disabling me from defining for you. For myself, I see “Passion
moulding or influencing Intellectual Forms.” As the language stands hitherto,
I do not see my way of getting out of the two terms. You want, on the
lowest steps, a very elementary description—something far below the Poet—something
as yet far short of the sublime, the beautiful, and the wonderful.
Tell me some one who has felt fear, or anger, or love, or hate—how these
have affected for him the objects of simple apprehension or of conception; of
sight, for instance—of sound? Has anything through his fear seemed larger—through
his hate wickeder, than it is? For that differencing of an object by a
passion, I know no name but Imagination. It is the transformation of a
reality; that seems to me to be the ground of what we more loftily apprehend
under the name Imagination.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great differences in the different psychological states and facts
arising out of the different passions or passionate moments, are various, endless.
Such influences from pleasure and pain, from loves of some sort,
and from hates of some sort, take effect for us in all the objects with
which we have intercourse. They make what it is to us. They make man
what he is to us. They are the life of our souls. They are given to all
human spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Poet himself has declared in the outset the purpose of his Poem. It
is to establish in the mind of his readers the belief in the Two great
Truths:—That the Universe is under the government of Eternal and Omnipotent
Wisdom:—and that this Government, as far as it regards Mankind,
is holy, just, and merciful. This essential truth, infinitely the most important
that can be entertained, since it comprehends all our good, all our evil—all
happiness, all misery—temporal—eternal;—all the destinies and conditions
of the human race;—was worthy the taking-in-hand of such a Teacher.
This truth He <em>might have</em> illustrated, from <em>any</em> part of human history;—and
with great power and evidence from a great many parts—both for obedience
and for disobedience—in the case of individuals <em>and of</em> communities.</p>

<p class='c008'>But He found one part of human history, where this truth shines out in
its utmost strength—namely, where the Obedience and Disobedience are
those of two individuals, and, at the same time, of all Mankind;—and where
the illustration of the truth is beyond all comparison convincing, since the
conjunction of the Happiness and the Obedience is <em>here</em> promulgated—since
the Happiness and the Obedience are <em>here</em> formally bound together—the
Disobedience and the Misery—by the promising and the menacing voice of
the Almighty.—The <em>Disobedience takes effect</em>;—and first creates human misery.</p>

  </div>

<p class='c008'>Milton took then this instance, <em>preferable</em> to all others, because above all
others it emblazons, as if in characters written by the finger of Heaven, the
Truth which he would teach;—notwithstanding the stupendous difficulties of
the attempt into which he plunged;—committing himself, as He thus did, to
unfolding before mortal gaze the Courts of Heaven;—to divulging for mortal
ears colloquies held upon the celestial everlasting Throne;—to delineating
the War of Creatures (<em>i. e.</em> the Angels) against the Creator, &#38;c. &#38;c.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Observe, moreover, that, although Man’s Obedience and Fall from Obedience
is the <em>theme</em> undertaken, yet the <em>Truth</em> undertaken has other illustration,
in the Poem, and reaches into higher Orders of Being. For instance, in
the Order of Angels, there occurs <em>twofold</em> illustration—namely,</p>

<p class='c008'>1. By the Opposition presented of unfallen and fallen Angels.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. And, amongst the rebellious Angels themselves, by the unspeakable
contrast exhibited of their first happy and their second unhappy state;—their
sinless glory and their horrible punishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Far higher yet,—immeasurably higher,—in the divine Messiah, the <em>Obedience</em>
is the grace, the glory, and the happiness of his Being!</p>

<p class='c008'><em>God</em> is the Creator and Upholder—<em>Satan</em>, the Destroyer. <em>God</em> is the rightful
Monarch of the Universe, unassailably seated on his everlasting Throne.
<em>Satan</em> ever attempts Usurpation, and is ever baffled.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Pride</em> is the inward Self-exaltation of a Creature. Observe that <em>Exaltation</em>
is proper <em>raising from</em> a lower degree held to a higher degree, not before
held. God is eternally the Highest;—a state which precludes the idea,
strictly spoken, of Exaltation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore, to Satan, as proud, is opposed the <em>Self-humiliation</em> of the Son—whom
God thereupon exalts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pride, in Satan, considered as <em>undue</em> Self-<em>exaltation</em>, stands (when we follow
out the opposition in which he stands to God) opposed to <em>due</em>, legitimate,
rightful height, or Supremacy, Sovereignty. <em>Satanic Pride</em> is undue self-exaltation,
at the height, in the Creature.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this, in the Creature, is a self-enthroning, a self-idolising, a self-deifying.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you ask for One Relation, that shall contain all the others, it is <em>this One</em>,
Dependency. That is to say, that, so long as you own your dependency,
so long is there no true relation that you can deny. But, if you deny your
dependency, therewith and therein you deny <em>all</em> your other true relations.
The <em>first</em> motion towards (<em>i. e.</em> in the direction of—<em>i. e.</em> relating to) God, of
pride in the proud Creature, is the denial of <em>dependency</em>. Satan <em>denies his
dependency</em>. Both in the <em>Past</em>—for he denies his Creation, and avers that he
had never heard such a thing mentioned. And in the <em>Present</em>, by renouncing
his allegiance, opening war, &#38;c. He denies the Creature’s continual derivation
from the Creator, when he says, (as if in the <em>Future</em>,) “our own right
hand <em>shall teach us</em> highest deeds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If it should appear necessary to vindicate expressly and at length the
character which has been affirmed as one main character of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>,
namely, that it is an <em>Ethico-didactic</em> Poem, the proofs offer themselves to the
hand more thickly than that they can easily be all gathered.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are <em>Implicit</em> and <em>Explicit</em>. The <em>Implicit</em> or inferential Proofs—Proofs
involved in the tenor of the displayed History, and which are by
reflection to be drawn out and unfolded—are of several kinds, and, in each,
of the highest description.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, the Main Action of the Poem, or <em>the Fall of Man</em>, teaches us that
the Goodness and Happiness of the Creature subsists in the inviolable conformity
of his Will to the holy Will of the Creator. Thus again:—The great
Action is <em>inductive</em> to this Main Action—that is to say, <em>The Fall of the Angels</em>,
which, by an easily-springing sequence of Moral Causes and Effects, brings
on the Temptation, and, too easily, the Seduction of Man—as loudly inculcates
the same sublime and all-comprehending Ethical Truth. And thus
again:—That Third <em>highest</em> Action, which is incorporated into the Main action—<em>The
Redemption of Man</em>—provided, in the Counsel of God, as remedial
to the fatal Catastrophe of the Fall, and, according to the reverently-daring
representation of the Poet, as undertaken in Heaven even ere the need that
asks for it has befallen in Paradise upon Earth—this awful Mystery of the
Divine interposing Grace irresistibly preaches the same solemn doctrine.
Hell, and Earth, and Heaven proclaim with One Voice:—“Cleave, Oh
Child of dust and Heir of Immortality, cleave and cling inwardly, by thy
love—by thine obedience, outwardly—to the all-wise and all-righteous Will,
which has called the Worlds and their Inhabitants into Being, and has imposed
upon the worlds, and upon those which inhabit them, its bountiful and
upholding Laws!—O cleave and immovably cling to that holy and gracious
Will, which the Angels forsook and they fell!—which Man deserted, and—He
fell!—which the Son of Man fulfilled, and He lifted up fallen and lost,
but <em>now restored</em> Man to the peace of God upon this Earth, and to the bosom

<p class='c008'>Milton represents inordinate Pride, or the temper, in excess, of inward self-exaltation,
as the chief element in the personal character of Satan; yet the
great Archangel has maintained his Obedience to the Almighty King.
The opinion of wrong done to himself, of an imposed humiliation in another’s
exaltation exasperating his haughty self-idolatry, first rouses him into active
disloyalty and rebellion, and to the desire and endeavour of dispossessing the
Monarch of Heaven, and reigning in his stead. The open outward war
which Satan is represented as waging with sensible weapons and armoury,
with innumerable spirits banded in confederacy upon his part—the setting
up his own throne in the north—the march across heaven—the attempt,
such as it is described, at invading the very throne of Omnipotence—amongst
other lights in which they may be contemplated, may be contemplated
in this light, namely, that the Outward expresses, depictures the Inward.
The proud Apostate Spirit, in conceiving offence and displeasure at God’s
rule and ordinance, has already within his own mind rebelled against God—he
has made his own Mind the field of an impious war.—We must conceive
within his mind a sovereign throne erected, whereupon,—so long as He
remained obedient, loyal, good,—the rightful Monarch sate, in undisputed
supremacy.—From that Throne within his mind, as soon as Satan rebels, in
will, God is dispossessed:—and on that internal usurped Throne the rebel
now sits;—in imagination, his own King, and his own God. That which
outwardly he attempts, and in which outwardly he must fail:—that inwardly
he has attempted—and in that—attempting it—inwardly He must succeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A Spirit created good and great has voluntarily foregone its native inborn
goodness, and, in consequence, involuntarily foregoes its native inborn
greatness. There is in the Universe but one fountain of all that is holy,
divine, good, amiable or pure.—This left, we drink troubled waters. No one
can tell the alliances of wrong with wrong. Truth, justice, good-will—alone
are magnanimous. He who has been shown at the highest of self-power,—of
intellectual strength—of empire over spirits—of their willing idolatry,
which extols him equal to the Highest in Heaven,—He is gradually brought
down low, lower, lowest—by voluntary and imposed humiliation:—self-incarnate
in bestial slime—turned into a monstrous serpent on his belly prone,
and hissing amongst hissing. Has Milton in painting the fallen Archangel
changed his hand, and checked <em>his</em> pride? He has delineated for our admiration;
he has delineated for our scorn—for our pity, also.</p>

<p class='c008'>One meaning pervades the delineation. The pride which alienates Satan
from God, alienates him at last from himself.—He is wicked, and the ways
of wickedness are crooked and creeping. The haughtiest of spirits in seeking
to revenge his just punishment stoops to the lowest abasement. A great
lesson is written on the front of this great revolution. A mind has let go
of its only stronghold, and it slips lower and lower. We have seen a
Spirit exalted in the favour of the Creator;—high in rank, strong in power,
rich in gifts, radiant with glory, seated in bliss;—and the same cast down
into misery and into dishonour. The Cause is, that he has deserted Obedience
and Love.</p>

Heavenly gifts are yours, and heavenly favours; and notwithstanding the
fall of man, gleams, vestiges are yours of heavenly glory. To you the
same choice is offered of adhering, or of separating yourselves. In you
is the same ground of temptation, the same difficulty of adhering, a misunderstood
<em>self-love</em>. You too are tempted to enthrone self upon the
usurped throne of the divine legislator. To obey the law of right—to follow
out the law of love, is only difficult because we feel, in every instance of
being called upon so to do, that we are called upon to make some sacrifice
of ourselves. It is an error—a mistaken feeling. We are called upon to
sacrifice not ourselves, but a <em>present inclination</em>, which self suggests. Make
the sacrifice—obey, fulfil the law that makes the claim upon you, and you
will find that you have relinquished a fallacious, for a real good. Follow the
false inclination, and you will find that instead of enthroning yourselves in
the despite of Heaven’s King, you have begun to descend steps of endless
descent.—Be warned by terrible example.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We see of mankind some that are lifted up in power and exalted by their
native powers—mighty minds holding ascendancy over other minds—Kings—Conquerors—Philosophers—sitting
upon the thrones of the Earth, or upon
intellectual thrones. To them there is the same hazard. There is the same
inward solicitation of pride—the same impulse to self-idolatry. They
would usurp—would extend power. Adversaries of God and Man—and
knowing themselves for such—the madness of Ambition seizes upon their
hearts, and on they go. They seek Exaltation—they find abasement. The
false aggrandisement which they have laboured to acquire may or may not be
wrested from them. But assuredly the inward abasement will hold on its
appointed way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their end is high, but their means will be low. Ambition disjoined from
good is divorced from true greatness. The consciousness of right aims alone
sustains the genuine self-respect of the mind, struggling its way through the
obstacles which the strife of human affairs presents. One law—one principle—one
rule of action—takes dominion of the spirit which has surrendered itself
to the allurement of a selfish ambition:—It has One Motto—one war-cry—“<em>To

uses the high gifts of intelligence not for extending the useful domains of

him though, to plant his proud reputation, and multiply the train of his
adherents, he must pull down heavenward hopes, in millions of human hearts?—that

talents implies that he who is in this way proud, views his talents, in
a measure, as originally his own. He refers them to himself, and not beyond.
If he looked at them as given, there would be an end of Pride, which would

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Upon a day of the heavenly year the Almighty Father, upon his Holy
Mount, before the assembled Angels, manifests the Son—proclaims the Son,
the head over all Principalities and Powers, and requires to be paid him
accordingly the homage and obedience of the whole angelical host. The
whole angelical Host pay, as required, their homage. But not all gladly and
sincerely. One of the highest Archangels—if not the highest—whose
heavenly name is heard no more—but upon Earth and in Hell he is called
Satan and Lucifer—envies and revolts in heart at this new vicegerency. He
intends rebellion:—beguiles the next Angel in authority under him, and with
him, pretending a command from the celestial King, withdraws the legions
who are bound in service to his hierarchal standard into the northern quarter
of Heaven. With such precision does Milton dare to imagine, even in the
highest, the scenes and procedure of his Poem. There the false Archangel
proposes to his followers that they shall resist the ordinance imposing a new
reign over them. The followers thus addressed are <em>one third part</em> of the
whole celestial host. One Seraph resists—refuses to forego his original,
proper allegiance, and flies back. The rest march in arms against the Mount
of God. They are encountered by an equal number of the faithful Angels.
Two days the fight rages in the celestial fields. The second of the two days
closes the unequal, hopeless conflict. The Messiah goes forth to war; and
the rebellious angelical multitude are precipitated from the verge of Heaven
into the fiery pit of Hell, newly created, and yawning to receive the vanquished
and cast-out numbers without number from their unimaginable fall.</p>

<p class='c008'>What, according to Milton, is Pride? Milton’s answer is in one word.
Satan aspires to sit upon the Throne of God. Then in angel or in man there
is but one meaning of the word Pride. He unseats God, and sets up another—namely,
Self—in his place. The comparison of Man’s Sin to Satan’s,
is by Milton distinctly affirmed. The Almighty says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“——<em>Man disobeying</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Disloyal breaks his fealty, and sins</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the high supremacy of heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Affecting Godhead</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I suppose the meaning to be universally applied to man’s transgression—namely,
to break a law is virtually to set aside the Lawgiver, and to legislate
for yourself. The act may, indeed, be more or less conscious, wilful, reflective;
may more or less <em>intend</em> siege and defiance to Heaven. Proud Sin <em>most
intends</em> this; and even the Sin of Pride, simply as constituted in the Will,
ere going forth into action. I understand that moral offences, into which
impetuous passions hurry, however undeliberated, and although they <em>intend</em>
simply the gratification of desires, and cannot well be said to include a proud
scorn of the laws that they break—for there is often more rash oblivion of
than stiff-necked opposition to the laws broken—yet partake of the character
condemned in Satan; and condemned in man also by these words put into
the mouth of the Almighty. Every the most thoughtless and reckless breach
of a law sets aside the Lawgiver, and usurps legislation to the law-breaker.
The law-breaker makes his own law. No doubt, however, there are more
heedful offenders. There are those who look the law in the face, and with
impious hardness of heart, and wilfully approaching God, break his laws.
They are proud Sinners.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is not so much perceptive or demonstrative as it is enkindling: a dear
and near tie—elation by consciousness of a high purpose in his Creation,
and gratitude for the love which thus ennobled him in creating him. If he
reverences himself he is bound to a Creator, whose designs in him are thus
expounded. Related hereto, but distinct, and more incidental, is the Philosophy
of Man’s nature, propounded by Raphael, who nevertheless propounds
as if upon divine revelation made to himself at the moment. This philosophy,
delivered in three words, appears to me exceedingly sublime, and profoundly
true.</p>

<p class='c008'>I imagine, because self-knowledge includes the distinct <em>intelligence</em> of

understand his happiness, and be ungrateful. How can you to the Giver of

<p class='c008'>Sanctity of Reason is hallowed and hallowing Intelligence. It is implied

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The sublime passage, which describes Man’s creation, besides the
moral influence and incitement of its main bearing—that Man is “the
end of all yet done”—that he is made in the likeness of God—that
here only the Father is distinctly and especially announced as consulting
and co-operating with the Son—besides the call that is thus made upon
Man to revere and guard the Spirit implanted in him—and besides the
formal precept with which it concludes, inculcating compliance with the
sole prohibition, is, in the following respect, also remarkable, when we
look for testimonies to the frame of mind in which the Poem was written.
To wit: The passage appears to embosom, in a very few words—in
half-a-dozen verses—an entire system of Ethics in the germ, or general
thought. Milton appears to lay as its basis the faculty which Man possesses
of <em>Self-Knowledge</em>, which he seems nearly to identify with Reason.
Hence, very loftily, but very summarily, he deduces the general moral
condition of Man, and his highest, that is to say, his religious obligations.
We must understand, no doubt, that the other inferior obligations are to
be similarly deduced. But the bare fact, that Milton <em>so places</em> (and so
compendiously) this high and comprehensive speculation in a striking
manner, attests the temper of thinking in which the whole Poem has been composed.
In such a fact we unequivocally read that which has been repeatedly
here affirmed upon all kinds of evidence,—that the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> was to
Milton the depository (within room at once confined and ample) for his lifelong
studies; and in particular, that, holding the office of a Poet at the
highest—that is to say, seeing in every one upon whom the high faculties of
Poetry are bestowed, a solemn and missioned Teacher to Men, Milton hoped,
in this great Poem, to acquit himself of this responsibility laid upon his own
Spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Kingdom of God’s Love, to obey him and to promote happiness is
one and the same thing. To disobey him and to destroy happiness is one
and the same thing. If it were possible for a finite being to see the consequences
of his actions as God sees them, he would perform precisely the
same actions, whether he aimed at augmenting to the utmost the welfare of
God’s Creation, or endeavoured to the utmost to conform his actions to
God’s Will.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unable to penetrate consequences, should he have access to know God’s
Will—he will by this means have a safe rule of effecting that which the
right, loving disposition of his Mind desires, but which his imperfect foresight
disables him from accomplishing by his own computation of results.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Nor is it unreasonable to say that nations unvisited by God’s Word have
access to know, in some imperfect measure, his Will—and to use it for
their guidance—and that they have done so;—for all the nobler nations,
and perhaps all the nations—or all, with few exceptions—at least those high
Gentile nations who have left us their own hearts disclosed and recorded in
writings, have witnessed, as follows:—They have regarded the primary Affections
by which the family is bound together within itself—and those affections
by which a nation is bound as a brotherhood within itself—as Divine
Laws speaking in their bosoms. Yet more solemnly they have acknowledged
the voice of Conscience, dividing Right from Wrong, in each man’s innermost
Thoughts, as a divine oracle, shrined in the human heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, Talboys; their Orators, their Historians, their Philosophers, their

thus apprehended themselves to live under a Divine Legislation.</p>

    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When, therefore, not idly and presumptuously arrogating to themselves to
divine and calculate consequences removed from their faculties, they did, in
simplicity of soul, follow out the biddings of these holy charities, and the dictates
of this inwardly prophesying monitor, they were so far, in the light
and in the eye of Reason—<span class='fss'>VIRTUOUS</span>. They did so far—if we may dare so
highly to pronounce—conform themselves to God’s will. They did this,
designing—even in the dim light in which they walked—to do this. And so
far conforming themselves, after their imperfect apprehension, to his laws,
they were so far producers of happiness. Their conformity—their production
of human happiness, and their virtue—flowed in one channel—were one and
the same stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even this solemn conviction, which seems to carry its own evidence in itself,
derives confirmation from weighing the connection of human happiness with
human actions. The feelings which carry us to accept implicitly, and without
the suggestion of a doubt, the Will of God as the law of our actions, are in
themselves principal sources of Happiness—the Obedience itself is the firmest
and only secure foundation of Happiness. He whose will we are to obey is
the Sole Giver of Happiness. And if we could begin with searching our own
Being into its depths—the laws of Happiness which we should there discover
would point out to us, as the effectual and unfailing sources, and the necessary
condition of happiness, those qualities of action, which we know as the
immutable attributes of the Divine Will—Truth, Justice, Holiness, Love.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Moral Nature of Man is to be regarded as something which may rise
from very low to very high degrees. And what is manifestly true of it in one
state may not be as manifestly true of it in another. To understand it, my
dear friends, we must regard it in its nearest approaches to perfection. From
that observation of it, we must endeavour to establish principles, and deduce
Rules, which we may be able afterwards to apply to judging of its inferior
states. We cannot equally expect, from observing its inferior states, to find
the rule that will enable us to comprehend its highest.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The highest Moral State of the Human Mind is unquestionably that in
which it knows Deity, in his perfections; in which his Known Law is adopted
as the express and supreme Law of Life;—in which the affections due towards
him are strong, pure, full, habitual;—in which all the other affections, under
subordination to these, are directed, each in due degree, towards its due
object; and in which Conscience is known, as a declarer of the Divine Will,
when other testimony is silent, is revered as such, and holds authority sufficient
to decide the choice whenever the Will fluctuates in its Obedience to
its highest affections.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>From this state, which is that to which every human being is bound to
aspire, you would deduce grounds of judging of those inferior moral conditions
which tend to the attainment of this highest?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I would; and it will be found that these are moral, either because they
bear an imperfect and broken resemblance to this state, or because they have
a visible tendency towards it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Believing, then, that the Human Soul only reaches the fulness of its nature,
and the exaltation of its powers, when it Knows itself in the presence of God,
when it looks up to Him, and endeavours, not in hidden thought merely, but
in action and life, to adore His Will, we must not allow as possessing the
same excellence, and participating in the same Nature of Morality, any state
in which we cannot discern footsteps of the same Deity, where the breath of
the same spirit cannot be felt? That, on the other hand, we embrace with
affection, and with moral anticipation, whatever seems even remotely to be
animated with this influence, and to tend to this result?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Yes. To an observer looking in this spirit upon the affairs of men, there
will be no difficulty in approving and condemning those who, in the same light
as he himself enjoys, conform to or contemn what he acknowledges as the
highest Law. The two extremes of virtue and crime fall distinctly and decisively
under the test which he recognises. The nature of the merit, the
nature of the Guilt, of those who in the highest degree conform to this Law,
and of those who most audaciously trample upon it, cannot be mistaken.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c008'>But between these there are infinite degrees, to which it may often be
extremely difficult to apply the same rule of Moral Estimation.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Alas! alas! He who looks forth from himself with the views of human
perfection which I have described, must regard the world with sorrow and
compassion, perceiving how much the great body of mankind are departed
from the happiest and fittest condition of their nature—how they are become
immersed in passions and pursuits which disguise from their own knowledge
the very capacities of their being, and degrade and destroy their powers by
withholding from them even the prospect of their original destination!</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>But when he descends from that height of contemplation, and, mixing with
them, makes himself more intimate with their actual condition, he will look
on them in some degree in a different light; for, my good Seward, he will
then consider, not so much what they <em>want</em> of perfection, as those <em>tendencies
towards</em> it, which are still actually undestroyed among them, and which are
continually found exerting themselves—with irregular impulses, indeed, and
with uncertain and variable direction; but which still do exert themselves,
throwing gleams over human nature of its true happiness, and maintaining to
Man, in the midst of all his errors, the name and dignity of a Moral Being.</p>

<p class='c008'>Methinks, sir, what would appear to such a Mind most grateful and consolatory
in the midst of the aberrations of the human Soul, and of its darkness
as to the knowledge of its Chief Good, must be the sight of those
beautiful Affections which fill the hearts of human beings towards one
another, and the observations of the workings of that Conscience, which in its
mysterious intimations admonishes men of their departure from the Eternal
Laws, though they know not whence the voice comes, nor how profound is
its significance. In these great and pure affections, and in the rectitude of
conduct thus maintained, he would recognise the fulfilling of that Divine
Will, in harmony with which is all Good, and in revolt from which is all
Evil. To him, then, the Human Will would appear thus far to maintain its
conformity with the Divine: and he would witness Obedience to the Universal
Law, although those who fulfilled it did but imperfectly understand their
own Obedience, or conceive to what authority it was paid.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If the great natural Affections were made at first in perfect harmony with
the Affections of Religion, they will still bear that character. And they do
so, for they still appear to us in themselves pure and holy. If that is their
character, then their very presence in the soul will be in some degree a restoration
of its own purity and holiness. And this also is universally felt to be
true: to such a degree that, most strongly to describe those feelings, we apply
to them terms derived from the language of religion. We call those ties
sacred: we call those duties Piety. They re-induce upon the Soul that purer,
loftier nature, which the ordinary course of the world has troubled; and in
doing so, they not only bring the Mind into a State which is in harmony with
the Divine Law, but they do, to a certain degree, begin Religion in the
Soul. This intimate connection between the strongest feelings of the heart
and its holiest thoughts, discovers itself when the whole heart is wrung by
the calamities to which through those feelings it lies open. When the hand
of Death has rent in one moment from fond affection the happiness of years,
and seems to have left to it no other lot upon Earth than to bleed and
mourn, then, in that desolation of the spirit, are discovered what are the
secret powers which it bears within itself, out of which it can derive consolation
and peace. The Mind, torn by such a stroke from all those inferior
human sympathies which, weak and powerless when compared to its own
sorrow, can afford it no relief, turns itself to that Sympathy which is without
bounds. Ask of the forlorn and widowed heart what is the calm which it
finds in those hours of secret thought, which are withdrawn from all eyes?—ask
what is that hidden process of Nature, by which Grief has led it on to
devotion? That attraction of the Soul in its uttermost earthly distress to a
source of consolation remote from Earth, is not to be ascribed to a Disposition
to substitute one emotion for another, as if it hoped to find relief in dispelling
and blotting out the vain passion with which it laboured before: but, in the
very constitution of the Soul, the capacities of human and of divine affection
are linked together; and it is the very depth of its passion that leads it over
from the one to the other. Nor is its consolation forgetfulness. But that
affection which was wounded becomes even more deep and tender in the midst
of the calm which it attains.</p>

    <div>SEWARD.</div>

<p class='c008'>Assuredly such a spectator of human nature as we have imagined could
not be indifferent to such a tendency of these natural emotions. He could
not observe with unconcern even the nascent streaks of light, the dawning of
a religious mind. He would call that <span class='sc'>Good</span> which, though it had no distinct
and conscious reference to anything above the Earth, did yet, by the very
preparation it made in the Soul for the reception of something more holy,
vindicate to itself a heavenly origin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the Ancients, contemplating that Power in the Mind which judges
so supremely of Right and Wrong, could call it nothing else than a God
within us. He then who, in the highest light of knowledge, contemplates the
human mind, will be yet more strongly impressed with this <span class='sc'>Sanctity</span> of the
Conscience, which affected even minds lying under much darkness and abasement,
and therefore alienated from such perceptions. He undoubtedly will
regard this principle as a part of original Religion not yet extinct in the Soul:
will, as such, esteem and revere it; and conceiving the highest perfection of
human nature to consist in its known and willed Conformity to the Divine
Will, will regard with kindred feelings even this imperfect and unconscious
conformity to that Law, which is thus maintained by the human spirit, resolutely
and proudly struggling, in the midst of its errors, against a yet deeper
fall.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, sir, it must be remembered that, as the degrees of moral goodness
are different in the various dispositions and actions of men, though they all
fall under the description of one morality; so, too, the feeling of moral approbation
exists in very different degrees in different minds, though in all it
bears a common name. If the moral sensibility is not enlightened and
quickened by those feelings which belong to its most perfect state, its judgments
will be proportionally faint and low. As in its virtue there is a lower
virtue, which tends merely to a Harmony with the Divine Will, so, in the
judgment of virtue, there is a lower judgment, which implies no more than
that he who judges has his own mind brought into a state in which there is a
tendency to the same sacred and solemn apprehensions.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Moral judgments of men are vague and undefined; but they are accompanied
universally with a solemn feeling: not merely of dislike—not, in the
highest degree, of mere detestation and hate—not merely with reproach and
resentment for violating the benevolence, and invading the happiness of human
nature; but there is a sensation of awe accompanying the sentiment of condemnation,
which visibly refers to something more than what is present to
our eyes on the face of the smiling or the blasted Earth. Among all nations,
the abhorrence and punishment of crime has always reference to some
indignation that is conceived of among higher powers. Their Laws are
imagined to be under a holier sanction, and in their violated majesty
there is apprehended to be something of the anger of offended Deity.
Hence the wrath of Punishments, which have been conceived of as fulfilling
heavenly displeasure; and those who have inflicted signal retributions have
imagined that they avenged their Gods as well as the broken laws of men.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TALBOYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This feeling of a superhuman authority present in the affairs of men shows
decisively what is the tendency, in natural minds, of moral feeling, when it is
aroused to its greatest height; the season in which it may be expected best
to declare its own nature.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Nor did this awe of a superior power present in the consciences of men,
and violated there, discover itself solely in the vindications of punishment;
but the great acts of virtue also led men to thoughts above humanity; nor
did they otherwise conceive of the impulses of the mind, in the noblest actions,
than as inspirations from the divinity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same truths, deeply buried in human nature, may be recognised in
different forms wherever its voice speaks in its strength. If one people have
believed that Furies rose from their infernal beds to dog the steps of the
murderer, wandering upon the Earth, others, from the same source of preternatural
feeling, have believed that the body would bleed afresh at his approach,
and that his unappeased ghost would haunt the place where Guilt had driven
it out from life. The very conception of such crimes dilates the spirit to conceptions
of the unseen powers which reign over human life, which walk unperceived
among the paths of men, and which are universally believed to be
enemies or punishers of human wickedness. If the history of superstition
might be told at large, it would represent to us the conscience of man laid
open by his Imagination, and would disclose, in fearful pictures, the reality of
that connection which subsists in our nature between the apprehension of
Good and Evil in the soul of man, and the apprehensions cognate with it of
a world of invisible power, of which it is the eternal law that Good is required,
and Evil hated and pursued.</p>

<p class='c008'>These evidences attest that, even among those who have the least knowledge
of Religion, whose judgments are least moulded by its spirit, there is
an inseparable connection between Conscience and Religion; that its strong
emotions always carry the soul to those conceptions which are most akin to
its powers.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, under the circumstances which produce the strongest feeling, such a tendency
shows itself distinctly and in remarkable forms, then, under all circumstances,
there will be fainter and more indistinct perception of this tendency?</p>

<p class='c008'>For this is the nature of the human Mind. Our feelings are not always
determined by distinct thought; but there is a sort of presaging faculty in
the soul, by which it foresees whither its own conception tends, and <em>feels</em>, in
anticipation of those thoughts, into which the imagination would run if it
were left free.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Thus certain strains of thought are felt to be joyous or solemn when they
are barely touched, and in the ready sensibility, feeling begins to arise, though
no ideas are yet distinctly present to which such feeling fitly belongs. The
mind shudders or is gladdened at the distant suggestion of what it knows, if
pursued, would shake it with horror, or fill the blood with joy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>This is a fact of our nature too well understood by those whose mind
labours with any store of fearful or bitter recollection, into which they dread
to look. The approach to some place hideous to the memory produces the
shivering of horror before it is beheld; and even within the spirit, in like
manner, the approach to those dark places of thought where unsoothed sorrows
lie buried, startles the mind, and warns it to turn the steps of thought
another way.</p>

<p class='c008'>The feeling that “that way madness lies;” and the recoiling from it,
through a forefeeling of the pain which lies in the thoughts that might arise,
is common to all strong passion that has held long possession of the mind.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A similar state is known in these imitations of passion, the works of art;—Music
has power over us, not by the feelings which it produces distinctly in
the mind, but by those many deep and passionate feelings which it barely
touches, and of which it raises up, therefore, from moment to moment, obscure
and undefined anticipations. In Painting, the Imagination is most powerfully
excited often not by what is shown, but by what is dimly indicated.
What is shown exhausts and limits the feelings that belong to it; what is
indicated merely, opens up an insight into a whole world of feelings inexhaustible
and illimitable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such, indeed, is the nature of our mind; and these are examples of a general
principle of thought and feeling.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This capacity of the Mind to be affected in slighter degree, but in similar
manner, by anticipated feeling, is to be noticed in respect to <em>all</em> its more fixed
and important emotions. It enters as a great element into all its moral
judgments. The judgment of right or wrong is quick and decisive, but is rather
unfrequently attended with very strong emotion. Those strongest emotions
belong to rare occurrences; for the greater part of life is calm. But they have
been felt, nevertheless, at times; so that the soul distinctly knows what is its
emotion of moral abhorrence, and what its emotion of moral veneration.
When lesser occasions arise, which do not put its feeling to the proof, it still is
affected by a half-remembrance of what those feelings have been: a slighter
emotion comes over it—an apprehension of that emotion which would be felt
in strength, if it could be given way to. Thus even the very name of crimes
affects the mind with a dim horror, though the Imagination is still remote
from picturing to itself anything of the reality of acting them. Whatever
great conceptions, then, are so linked in actual Nature with our moral emotions,
that under the passionate strength of these emotions they must arise, some
slight shadow of the same conceptions, some touch of the feelings which they
are able to call up, will be present to the mind whenever it is morally
moved.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SEWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ay, sir, I now see the meaning—of the application—of all your discourse.
If there is in the depth of our Nature such a connection between our Moral
and our Religious conceptions, that our moral feelings, when exalted or appalled
in the highest degree, will assume a decidedly religious character, then
even in their slighter affection they will be touched, even from a distance,
with that religious temper.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And does not this appear to be precisely the case?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SEWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It does appear that the two kinds of feelings are so connected, that in the
strongest moral feeling Religion is sensibly present, and that in its weaker
emotion there is a slight colouring of the same feeling—faint and indistinct
indeed, but such as to give to all our judgments of right and wrong a something
of solemnity that is distinct from the ordinary complexion of human
affairs, from the ordinary judgment of human interests or passions.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NORTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This connection which is perceived in individual Minds may be observed in
considering the differences of national character. The different nations of the
earth have exhibited the moral nature of man in very different degrees of
strength. It will be found that they have also possessed in very different
degrees the spirit of Religion; and that the two have risen or declined together.
This is true both of the nations of the old world who were enlightened, and of
the Christian nations, who have preserved their Religion in various degrees
of purity and truth, and whose morals have always borne a corresponding
character. If there is a people light and fickle in their moral character, the
same unfixedness and levity will be found in their religion. But whatever
nation has embraced with deep and solemn feeling the tenets of their faith,
will be found to be distinguished in proportion by the depth of their moral
spirit. The dignity of their Mind appears not in one without the other, but
in the two united.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, then, in those minds in which the two are imperfectly unfolded, they
are united, as in those in whom they are most perfectly unfolded. But with
this difference:—that where Religion in its most perfect form is known, there
it enlightens and exalts the moral feelings. Under its imperfect and erroneous
forms, conscience applies to men’s hearts in some degree the defects of
religion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Politics, since the year 1848, have
engrossed so unwonted a share of the
attention of the reading world, that
there can be no doubt that, in more
than one European country, books of
great literary and scientific interest
have been withheld from publication
until more tranquil days should give
them a better chance of the welcome
they merit. Such has avowedly been
the case with Dr Wagner’s latest
work, the fourth and most important
of a series suggested to him by several
years of Oriental travel and study.
It was, if we rightly remember, in the
second book of this series, relating to
Armenia,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> that he announced his intention
of reserving for a final work
the more important results of his rambles
and observations. Previously to
the Armenian volume he had published
his account of Caucasus and
the Cossacks,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> to the general reader
more interesting than any of its successors.
Third in order of appearance
came the Journey to Colchis;<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
and now, believing that his countrymen’s
taste for books of foreign travel
and adventure is reviving, he puts
forth two copious volumes, containing
all that he has to say, and that he has
not previously published, concerning
his Eastern journeyings and residence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr Wagner is one of the most experienced,
indefatigable, and, as we
believe, one of the most trustworthy
and impartial of foreign literary travellers.
On a former occasion we
explained how his strong natural
bent for travel and scientific research
had overcome many and great obstacles,
and had conducted him not only
through various European countries,
but with a French army to Constantina,
and afterwards over a great part
of Western Asia. His present book
is comprehensive and somewhat desultory
in its character. It details
the author’s residence in the Alpine
region of Turkish Armenia, his travels
in Persia, and his adventurous
visits to certain independent tribes of
Kourds, whose country is immediately
adjacent to that interesting but unsafe
district of Kourdistan, where Schulze,
the German antiquarian, and the
Englishman Browne (the discoverer
of Darfour) met a bloody death, and
rest in solitary graves. Dr Wagner
is sanguine that, now that the revolutionary
fever has abated, many will
gladly quit the study of newspapers,
and the contemplation of Europe’s
misty future, to follow him into distant
lands, rarely trodden by European
foot, and some of which have
hitherto been undescribed “by any
German who has actually visited
them.” As the most novel portions
of his book, he indicates his visits
to the mountain district south of Erzroum,
and his excursions east, south,
and west of the great salt lake of
Urumiah, the Dead Sea of Persia.
A keen politician, and this book being,
as we have already observed, a sort
of omnium-gatherum of his Eastern
experiences, political, scientific, and
miscellaneous, he devotes his first
chapter to what he terms “a dispassionate
appreciation of Prince Metternich’s
Oriental policy,” (chiefly with
respect to Servia,) which chapter we
shall avail ourselves of his prefatory
permission to pass unnoticed, as irrelevant
to the main subject of the
book. Equally foreign to the objects
announced in the title-page are the
contents of Chapter the Second, in
which, before taking ship for Trebizond,
he gives a hundred pages to the
Turkish capital, promising, notwithstanding
all that has of late years been
written concerning it, to tell us something
new about Constantinople, and
bidding his readers not to fear that he
is about to impose upon them a compilation
from the innumerable printed
accounts of that city, which have
issued from female as well as male
pens, “from the days of Lady Montague
down to Mrs Ida Pfeiffer the
far-travelled, and Madame Ida Hahn
Hahn the devotee.” He fulfils his
promise. His sketches from the Bosphorus
are not only amusingly written,
but novel and original. Dr
Wagner, it must be observed, set out
upon his Eastern wanderings well
provided with circular letters of recommendation
from Lord Aberdeen
and M. Guizot to the various British
and French agents in the countries he
anticipated visiting. From the Russian
government he also obtained,
although with greater difficulty, similar
documents. The natural consequence
was, that, at Constantinople,
and elsewhere, he passed much of his
time in diplomatic and consular circles,
and to such intercourse was
doubtless indebted for much useful
information, as his readers unquestionably
are for many pungent anecdotes
and entertaining reminiscences.</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon an early day of his stay in
Constantinople, Dr Wagner was so
fortunate as to enjoy a near and
leisurely view of his Highness Abdul
Meschid. It was a Friday, upon
which day the Grand Seignior is wont
to perform his devotions in one of the
principal mosques of his capital. In
the court of the great Achmet mosque,
Dr Wagner saw a crowd assembled
round a group of twenty horses,
amongst which was a slender, richly-caparisoned,
silver-grey Arabian, of
extraordinary beauty and gentleness.
It was a favourite steed of the Sultan’s.
Presently the door of the
mosque opened; the grey was led
close up to the lowest step; a slender
Turk came forth, descended the steps
stiffly and rather unsteadily, was
assisted into saddle and stirrup by
black slaves, and rode silently away
through the silent crowd, which gave
back respectfully as he passed, whilst
every head was bowed and every hand
placed upon the left breast. No shout
or cheer was heard—Turkish custom
forbidding such demonstrations—nor
did the sovereign requite by salute or
smile his subjects’ mute reverence.
At that time Abdul Meschid was but
twenty years old. His appearance
was that of a sickly man of thirty.
Early excesses had prematurely aged
him. His cheeks were sunken; lines,
rarely seen in youth, were visible at
the corners of his eyes and mouth;
his gaze was fixed and glassy. Dr
Wagner is witty at the expense of
another German writer,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> who saw the
Sultan since he did, and sketched his
personal appearance far more favourably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is possible, however,” he says,
“that with improved health the
Sultan’s figure may have improved
and his countenance have acquired
nobility, so as to justify the description
of the genial author of the ‘Fragments.’
Possible is it that Dr Spitzer’s<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
steel pills, combined with the seraglio-cook’s
strong chicken broth and baths
of Burgundy wine, may have wrought
this physical marvel, have given new
vigour to the muscles, have braced
the nerves, and have imparted to his
Highness’s drooping cheeks that firm
and healthful look which the learned
German declares he noted on the
occasion of his audience. Abdul
Meschid has still youth on his side;
and when such is the case, nature
often willingly aids the physician’s
inadequate art. At the time I speak
of, it is quite certain that the
young Sultan looked like a candidate
for the hospital. His aspect excited
compassion, and corresponded with
the description given to us of him by
the German sculptor Streichenberg,
who certainly contemplated his Highness
more closely and minutely than
the ‘Fragment’ writer, seeing that
his business was to carve the Padisha’s
likeness in ivory. As an artist, Mr
Streichenberg was not particularly
edified by the lean frame and flabby
countenance of so young a prince.
Not to displease his sublime patron,
he was compelled to follow the example
of that other German sculptor,
who, commissioned by his royal
Mæcenas to model his hand and leg
for a celebrated dancer, adopted, instead
of the meagre reality, the graceful
ideal of the Belvidere Apollo, and
so earned both praise and guerdon.
The person of the Grand Seignior
appeared to Streichenberg, as it did
to me, emaciated, relaxed, narrow-breasted,
and faded. Two years
later, when I again saw the Sultan,
in the solemn procession of the Kur-ban-Beiram,
a renegade, who stood
beside me, exclaimed, ‘Were I the
Sultan, and looked as he looks, I
would never show myself in public.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Close behind the Sultan rode the
chief of the eunuchs, a fat negro from
Sudan, mounted upon a horse as
black as himself; and behind him
came a young Turk of remarkable
beauty, whose thick raven-black
beard contrasted with the whiteness
of his complexion, as did his whole
appearance with that of the sickly
sovereign, and with the dingy, monkey-like
physiognomy of the Kisslar
Aga. Beside such foils, no wonder
that the picturesque young Oriental,
with his profile like that of some
Saracen warrior, and his dreamy
thoughtful eyes, found favour with
the fair. Riza Pasha was his name;
he was then the seraglio-favourite,
the lover of Valide, the mother of
the Sultan. He alone pulled the
strings of Turkish politics, and made
the lame old Grand Vizier, Rauf
Pasha, dance like a puppet to whatever
tune he piped.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sultan and his suite were attired
in the reformed costume—in blue
frocks of Polish cut, red trousers, and
the red fez, with its abundant blue
tassel drooping over it on all sides.
Scarcely had they ridden out of sight
when a group of very different character
and appearance issued from the
chief gate of the mosque, gathering
on its way far more demonstrations of
popularity than did Abdul Meschid
and his Kisslar Aga. It was composed
of Turkish priests and doctors—<em>Ulemas</em>,
with their <em>Mufti</em> at their
head—all in the old Turkish garb,
with ample turbans and huge beards.
The sympathy of the people with
these representatives of the old régime
was expressed by far lower bows, by
more fervent pressure of hand on
heart, than had greeted the Sultan’s
passage. The holy men looked
kindly upon the crowd, amongst
whom the Mufti occasionally threw
small coins, which naturally augmented
his popularity, and secured
him many followers and good wishes.
Dr Wagner remarks upon the present
contradictory and anomalous state of
Turkish dress. At the festival of the
Kurban-Beiram he saw the Sultan
and all the state officials, from the
Grand Vizier downwards, in European
uniforms—narrow trousers, gold epaulets,
tight-buttoned coats, collars
stiff with embroidery. But at the
collar the Frank ceased, and the Oriental
reappeared. There was the long
beard, and the brimless fez. With
this last item of costume, the boldest
Turkish reformer has not as yet dared
to interfere. The covering of the forehead
with a peak or brim to the cap
is an innovation for which the Turks
are not yet ripe. It is considered the
outward and visible sign of the Giaour,
and a Turk who should walk the
streets of Constantinople in a hat, or
in a cap with a peak, would be stoned
by the mob. The prejudice springs
from the duty stringently enjoined
upon every true believer, to touch the
ground with his forehead when praying.
Hence, to wear a vizard over the
brow appears to the Turk like contempt
of a religious law. A bold
European in the service of the Porte
advised Sultan Mahmoud to put
leathern peaks to his soldiers’ caps.
On duty they would keep off the sun;
at prayer-time the caps might be
turned round upon the head. But
Mahmoud, passionate reformer though
he was, shrank from offering so
deadly an affront to Turkish fanaticism.
Neither did he dare, like Peter
the Great, to crop his subjects’ beards.
The well-intended changes which he
did introduce were sufficiently startling,
and to many of them, even at
the present day, the nation is scarcely
reconciled. In a picturesque point of
view, the new style of dress, intended
as the signal of a general change in
Turkish usages and institutions, is
anything but an improvement upon
the old one. The physical prestige
of the Oriental departed with his
flowing robe, with his shawls and his
rich turban.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These fat-paunched, crooked-legged
pashas,” exclaims Dr Wagner,
“what caricatures they appear in
their buttoned-up uniforms! Formerly,
when the folds of their wide
garments concealed bodily imperfections,
the Turks were held to be a
handsome race. Now, in Constantinople,
a handsome man, in the reformed
dress, is an exception to the
rule. The Turks of the towns are
rarely slender and well-built; and the
tall, muscular figures which one so
commonly finds amongst Arabs,
Persians, and Tyrolese, are scarcely
ever to be seen in Turkey. Neither
do we see in Turkish cities anything
to remind us of the fine
knightly figures of the Circassians—although,
from the female side, so
much Circassian blood runs in the
veins of the higher classes of Turks.
The indolent manner of life, the
bringing up of boys in the harem
until the age of puberty, too early
indulgence in tschibouk-smoking and
coffee-drinking, and premature excesses
of another kind, have all contributed
to enervate and degrade an
originally vigorous and handsome
race.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the whole Beiram procession, Dr
Wagner declares, there were, besides
Riza Pasha, but two handsome men
amongst all the Turks of the
higher class there present. Of
the numerous array of officers and
soldiers, it was but here and there
that he saw one tolerably well-made,
and athletic figures were still more
rarely observable. Worse than any
looked the debilitated Sultan, cramped
in his tight coat, oppressed by his
heavy epaulets and gold lace, his
diamonds and his plumes, and leaning
languidly forward on his fine charger.
What a contrast with the portrait of
the Emperor Nicholas, which Dr
Wagner saw when visiting the summer
seraglio of Kadi-Köi! Opposite
to a divan upon which Abdul Meschid
was wont to repose—whilst his
tympanum was agreeably tickled by
the harmony of half-a-dozen musical
boxes, playing different tunes at the
same time—stood two costly porcelain
vases, whereon were painted likenesses
of the Emperor and Empress of
all the Russias. They were presents
from Nicholas to the Sultan. “The
Emperor’s gigantic and powerful frame
and martial countenance were admirably
portrayed. The painter had
given him a mien and bearing as
though he were in the act of commanding
his grenadiers. As a contrast,
I pictured to myself the Turkish
monarch reposing his feeble frame
upon the luxurious velvet divan; the
harmless ruler who prefers ease in his
harem to a gallop at the head of his
troops; the trill of his musical boxes,
and the flutes of dancing dervishes, to
the clatter of cuirasses and the
thunder of twelve-pounders.” Russia
and Turkey are well typified by their
rulers. On the one hand, vigour,
energy, and power; on the other,
weakness, decrepitude, and decline.
What wonder if, as Dr Wagner relates,
the young Archduke Constantine,
when visiting the city that bears
his name, gazed wistfully and hopefully
from the lofty gallery of the
Galata tower on the splendid panorama
spread before him, as though
dreaming that, one day, perhaps, the
double eagle might replace the crescent
upon the stately pinnacles of
Stamboul!</p>

<p class='c008'>After passing in review several of
the most remarkable men in Turkey,
Reschid Pasha, Omar Pasha the
Renegade, Tahir Pasha, the fierce
old admiral who commanded the
Turkish fleet at Navarino, and who—never
well disposed towards Christians—regarded
them, from that disastrous
day forward, with inextinguishable
hatred, Dr Wagner speaks
of the representatives at Constantinople
of various European courts,
briefly retracing some of the insults
and cruelties to which, in former
times, the ambassadors of Christian
sovereigns were subjected by the arrogant
Porte, and noting the energy
and success with which Great Britain
alone, of all the aggrieved powers,
and even before the empire of the
seas had become indisputably hers,
invariably exacted and obtained satisfaction
for such injuries. He remarks
with admiration upon the signal reparation
extorted by Lord Ponsonby
in the Churchill case, and proceeds to
speak in the highest terms of that
diplomatist’s able successor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The most prominent man, by his
political influence, as well as by his
spirit, character, energy, and nobility
of mind, in the diplomatic world of
Pera, was and is, to the present day,
the Englishman Stratford Canning.
With external advantages, also, Nature
has endowed this man more
richly than any of his colleagues,
whether Turks or Franks. He is of a
very noble figure, and possesses that
innate, calmly dignified majesty which
characterises Britannia’s aristocracy.
Totally free from affectation or theatrical
manner, he has a thoughtful
brow, marked with the lines of reflection
and labour, and fine deep blue
eyes, whose meaning glance seems to
reveal a host of great qualities, and
to tell, at the same time, that with
the highest gifts of a statesman is
here combined a warm, a generous,
and a sympathetic heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr Wagner was presented to Sir
Stratford Canning by a German friend,
and the ambassador seems completely
to have won his heart, partly by the
admiration he expressed of Circassia’s
heroic struggle against the overwhelming
power of the Czar, and by
his sympathy with the Nestorian
Christians of Djulamerk—at that time
persecuted and cruelly handled by
Beder Khan—but still more by the
general liberality of his views, and
by his un-diplomatic frankness of
speech and manner. The Doctor pays
a warm tribute to his high qualities, and
to his success and diplomatic triumphs
at Constantinople; and Dr Wagner’s
eulogiums are, in this instance, the
more to be valued that he does not
often bestow them upon our countrymen,
but more frequently dwells upon
their less amiable qualities. As a
philanthropist and man of high honour,
he says, Sir Stratford Canning is
really a rarity in old Byzantium,
where, for so many centuries, tyranny
and servility, corruption and lies, have
established their seat. And he proceeds
to exhibit the less favourable
side of the character of the diplomatic
corps at Constantinople, bearing with
particular severity upon an Austrian
envoy, concerning whom he tells some
good stories—one, amongst others,
of a diamond ornament, which brought
great ridicule and discredit upon the
internuncio. When Ibrahim Pasha
was driven out of Syria, the Sultan,
in token of his gratitude, ordered the
court jeweller to manufacture costly
diamond ornaments for the ladies of
the British and Austrian ambassadors.
Lady Ponsonby (we abridge from
Dr Wagner) duly received hers, but
Count Stürmer intimated, on behalf
of his lady, that she would prefer
ducats to diamonds. The cunning
Austrian well knew that upon such
occasions the jewellers were wont to
take large profits. So he had it mentioned
at the seraglio, by one of his
dragomans, that the ambassadress
was no lover of trinkets, but would
willingly receive their value. To this
there was no objection, and the pleasant
sum of half a million of piastres
was transferred from the Sultan’s
treasury to the internuncio’s strong
box. If the Austrian flattered himself
that the transaction would be
unknown, he was terribly mistaken.
Pera is the Paradise of evil tongues,
and next day the ambassadress’s dealings
in diamonds were the talk of
the town. Count Stürmer had many
enemies and no friends; even his
attachés had little attachment for
him; the story was too piquant to be
lost, and it was repeated with a thousand
good-natured embellishments
and commentaries, until it came round
to the ears of the person principally
concerned. Thereupon, the wily ambassador
devised a plan to outwit the
gossips. The finest diamond ornaments
in the best jeweller’s shop in
the bazaar were ordered to be sent to
the Austrian embassy, on approval.
An order for diamonds had been received
from Vienna. The jeweller,
anticipating a prompt sale and good
profit, hastened to send the best he
had. Meantime a number of the
members of the different embassies
were asked to dinner. At
dessert, Count Stürmer led the conversation
to the Sultan’s generosity
and gallantry to ladies, and, turning
to the Countess, asked her to
show their guests the beautiful set
of diamonds she had received as a
present from his Highness. Great
was the company’s admiration of the
costly jewels—far greater their astonishment
at this ocular refutation of
the current tale which had transformed
the brilliants into piastres.
They had thought the sources of their
information so sure! The ambassador
noted and enjoyed their confusion.
But, clever as the trick was—in
political matters its author had never
exhibited such ingenuity and inventive
talent—its success was but temporary.
The sharp noses of the Pera
gossips smelled out the truth. Having
served their purpose, the jewels
were returned to the jeweller, and
one may imagine the shout and halloo
that resounded through the drawing-rooms,
coffee-houses, and barbers’
shops of Pera and Galata, when the
real facts of the case were at length
verified beyond a doubt.</p>

<p class='c008'>The admission made by Dr Wagner
in another place, that the hotel
of the Austrian internuncio was remarkable
for its hospitality, and was
the chief place of meeting in Constantinople
for foreigners and natives
of distinction, should perhaps have
induced him to take a more indulgent
view of Count Stürmer’s
dealings in diamonds. Go where you
will, says a French proverb, you
shall always be welcome if you take
with you a fiddle and a frying-pan.
Dinners and dances are amongst the
most important of diplomatic duties;
and the Austrian may have thought
he could better dispense with diamonds
than with these. At his hotel,
during one of Dr Wagner’s visits to
Constantinople, that singularly successful
soldier of fortune, General
Jochmus, was a constant guest. This
fortunate adventurer, of insignificant
family at Hamburg, who has been
indebted, for his remarkable rise, partly
to his gallantry and talents, partly
to extraordinary good luck, and who
has passed through half-a-dozen services,
always with more or less distinction,
began his career in Greece,
afterwards joined the Anglo-Spanish
Legion, passed thence into the native
Spanish army with the rank of general,
quitted it on account of an insult
received from a French tailor settled
in Spain, and for which the feeble
and <em>Afrancesado</em> Christino government
dared not give him the satisfaction
he justly demanded, and, at the
time referred to by Dr Wagner, was
Ferik-Pasha in the Turkish service—subsequently
to become Imperial
minister under the brief rule of the
Archduke John. His skill as a chess-player,
Dr Wagner informs us, is still
more remarkable than his military
talent. When in command of the
Turkish army in Syria, at the time
that Ibrahim Pasha and his Egyptians
were about to retreat through
the desert, Jochmus, entering Damascus—long
a stronghold of chess—challenged
the best players in the
place to a match, and carried off the
victory. From this officer, and from
other Europeans of high rank in the
Turkish service, Dr Wagner, who
loves to speculate on the political
future of the East, and on the probable
or possible infringements of Russia
upon the territories of her weaker
neighbours, gathered opinions, valuable
although very various, as to the
military power of Turkey, and her
means of resistance to Muscovite aggression.
The Doctor entertains a
very high respect for the power of
Russia, strikingly illustrated by the
recent crisis, when, with one army
guarding Poland and another warring
in the Caucasus, she was able to lend
a third—not far short of two hundred
thousand men—to the neighbouring
empire, which was on the point of
being overturned by an insurgent province.
In his second volume he talks
ominously of the result of an anticipated
conflict between an Anglo-Indian
and a Russian army, predicting
victory to the latter, even
whilst recognising the justice of the
high encomiums passed by another
German writer on the corps of British
officers in India. “An impartial and
competent observer and judge of most
of the armies of Europe, Leopold von
Orlich, who has written a valuable
book of travels in India, assures us
that that numerous body of officers
(eight hundred and twenty staff officers,
and five thousand five hundred
of inferior rank) has not its equal in
the world with respect to military
spirit and efficiency, and that he never
witnessed in any army so much
mutual self-devotion as amongst the
officers and soldiers of the British
Indian host. Thirst for action, high
spirit, self-confidence and practical
good sense, are the special characteristics
of the English officers.” Than
this, nothing can be truer. Dr Wagner
proceeds to theorise on the probable
defection of the Sepoys, in the
event of a Russian army showing
itself on our Indian frontier. Theories
referring to such remote and improbable
contingencies we need hardly
be at the pains to combat; and, indeed,
were we to take up the argumentative
cudgels every time that Dr Wagner’s
frequent political digressions hold out
temptation so to do, we should get to
the end of our paper and have got
never a step from Constantinople.
Our present object being the general examination
of a book of travels, we prefer
accompanying the Doctor on board
the Austrian steamer Stamboul, bound
for Trebizond. Thence his road was
by land, south-eastward to Erzroum,
travelling with Turkish post-horses—not
in a carriage, but in the saddle and
with baggage animals—at first through
a garden of azaleas and rhododendrons,
of geraniums and ranunculuses; afterwards
through an Alpine district,
over dangerous mountain-paths, unequalled,
he declares, for the hazards
of the passage, by anything he
ever met with in the European Alps.
Whilst traversing these bridle-roads,
which are often scarcely two feet
broad, with precipices of giddy depth
now on the right hand and then
upon the left, travellers keep their
saddles and trust to the good legs,
prudence, and experience of their
horses. Dr Wagner witnessed more
than one accident. A pack-mule fell
over a precipice, but escaped with the
fright and a few bruises. A Turkish
official had a very narrow escape.
His horse slipped upon a wet rock,
fell, and lay where he fell. The Turk
found himself with half his body under
the horse, the other half hanging over
a gulf which gaped, in frightful profundity,
at the edge of the road. “I
had passed the dangerous spot,” says
the Doctor, “but one minute before
him; I heard the fall, looked round,
and saw the Turk just below me, in
that horrible position. The horse lay
with the saddle turned towards the
precipice, down which it seemed inevitable
that, at the first effort to rise,
he and his rider must fall. But the
animal’s fine instinct saved both itself
and its rider. Snorting, with dilated
nostrils and ears erect, the brave
horse gazed down into the chasm,
but made not the slightest movement.
The Turk remained as motionless; he
saw the peril and dared not even
shout for aid, lest he should scare his
horse. The utmost caution was necessary
in approaching him. Whilst the
Pole and I quickly alighted and
descended to his assistance, the
Turk’s companions had already got
hold of his bridle and coat skirts, and
soon horse and man stood in safety
upon their six legs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Pole here referred to—John
Saremba was his name—accompanied
Dr Wagner from Constantinople
as a sort of guide or travelling
servant, and was his stanch and
faithful follower during very long and
often dangerous wanderings. He
spoke Turkish and Italian, could
cook a good pilau, and handled his
sabre, upon occasion, with dexterity
and effect. The story of his eventful
life, which he related to his employer
after dinner at Gumysh Haneh,
a town between Trebizond and
Erzroum, whilst their companions enjoyed
the <em>Kef</em>, or Oriental idleness
after meat, is unquestionably the
most interesting digression of the
many in Dr Wagner’s book. Wonderful
to relate, Saremba, although a Pole
and a refugee, claimed not to be
either a count or a colonel. His
father had been a glazier in Warsaw,
and brought his son up to the
same trade. When the Polish revolution
broke out, in November
1830, young Saremba entered the
service as a volunteer, was present
at the battles of Grochow, Praga,
Iganie, Ostrolenka, but neither received
wounds nor obtained promotion.
It is rare to meet a Pole who
has not been at least a captain, (the
Polish army lists of that period being
now out of print.) Saremba admitted
that he had never attained even to a
corporal’s worsted honours. After
the capture of Warsaw, his regiment
retreated upon Prussian ground. Their
hope was that the Prussian king would
permit their passage through his territory,
and their emigration to America.
This hope was unfulfilled. They
were disarmed; for a few weeks they
were taken good care of; then they
were sent back to Poland, there to
be drafted into various Russian regiments,
or sent, by troops, to the interior,
or to Caucasus. The latter
was Saremba’s lot. Incorporated in a
Russian regiment of the line, and after
many changes of garrison, he found
himself stationed at the camp of Manglis,
in the neighbourhood of Teflis.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Saremba’s company there were
sixteen Poles besides himself. Seven
of them had fought in the revolutionary
war; the others were recruits,
enlisted since its conclusion. One
of the number was married. Their
treatment by the Russian officers was
something better than that of the
other soldiers, Russians by birth.
This proceeded from no sympathy
with the Polish cause, but from an
involuntary feeling of compassion for
men superior in breeding and education
to the Russian boors, and who
were condemned for political offences
to the hard life of a private soldier.
More dexterous and intelligent than
the Russians, the Poles quickly learn
their duty, and would monopolise
most of the chevrons of non-commissioned
officers, had not the colonels
of regiments instructions on this
head from the Czar, who has little
confidence in Polish loyalty. Saremba
was tolerably fortunate in his
commanding officer; but the latter
could not always be at his subaltern’s
elbow, and the poor Poles had much
to put up with—bad food, frequent
beatings, and extra duty, as punishment
for imaginary offences. When
to these hardships and sufferings was
added the constant <em>heimweh</em>—the
ardent and passionate longing after
home, which has often driven Swiss
soldiers, in foreign services, to desertion,
and even to suicide—no wonder
that every thought of the Poles was
fixed upon escape from their worse
than Egyptian bondage. There is
peculiar and affecting interest in
Saremba’s narrative of this portion
of his adventures, which Dr Wagner
gives in substance, he says, but, as
we are disposed to believe, pretty
nearly in the Pole’s own words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When off duty, we Poles often
assembled behind the bushes of the
forest that encircles the camp of
Manglis; sang, when no Russian was
within earshot, our national Polish
airs, which we had sung, during
the revolution, in the ranks of our
national army; spoke of our homes,
of days gone by, and of hopes for
the future; and often, when we
thought of all we had lost, and of our
bitter exile in a wild foreign land, we
all wept aloud together! Well for
us that none of our officers witnessed
that. It would have gone hard with us.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We formed innumerable plans of
flight into Turkey, but, lacking any
accurate knowledge of the country,
we for a long time dared not come to
a positive resolution. Meanwhile, we
took much trouble to acquire the Tartar
tongue, and to extract information
from the inhabitants concerning the
way to Turkey. One of our comrades
helped a Tartar peasant in the neighbourhood
of Manglis to cultivate his
fields, receiving no payment, in order
to make a friend of him, and to question
him about the country. The
Tartar soon divined his project, and
willingly lent himself to facilitate our
escape. Flight to Persia would have
been easiest; but the Tartar would
not hear of that, for he was a Sunnite,
and detested the heretic followers of
Ali. He advised us to fly to Lasistan,
as easier to reach than Turkish
Armenia. My comrade was compelled
to promise him that, once beyond
the Russian frontier, we would
adopt Islamism. The Tartar minutely
explained to him the bearings of
the heavens, taught him the names of
all the mountains and rivers we should
have to cross, and of the villages
in whose vicinity we must cautiously
conceal our passage. Should we find
ourselves in extreme difficulty or
danger, he advised us to appeal to
the hospitality and protection of the
nearest Mollah, to confide to him our
position, and not to forget to assure
him of our intention to become good
Mussulmans as soon as we were on
Turkish territory. After we had
quite made up our minds to desert
at all risks, we required full three
months for preparation. Wretched
as was our pay, and scanty and
bad our rations, we husbanded both,
sold our bread and sought to accustom
ourselves to hunger. Some of us
were mechanics, and earned a few
kopeks daily by work in our leisure
hours. I worked as glazier for
the Russian officers. Our earnings
were cast into a common fund. The
summer drew near its end: already
the birds of passage assembled and
flew away in large flocks over the
high mountains of Manglis. We
watched their flight with longing and
envy. We lacked their wings, their
knowledge of the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More than once we faltered in our
resolution. Some Russian deserters,
who had been captured and brought
back to camp by Cossacks, when
attempting to desert into Lesghistan,
were condemned to run the gauntlet
thrice through a thousand men, and we
Poles were compelled to assist in
flogging the poor wretches almost to
death. Deep and painful as was the
impression this made upon us, hope
and the ardent longing for freedom
were yet more powerful. We fixed
the day for flight. Only one Pole of
our company, who was married to a
Cossack’s widow, and had a child by
her, detached himself from us and
remained behind. With knapsacks
packed, and loaded muskets, we met,
at nightfall, in the forest. There we
all fell upon our knees and prayed
aloud to God, and to the blessed
Virgin Mary, that they would favour
our design, and extend over us their
protection. Then we grasped each
other’s hands, and swore to defend
ourselves to the utmost, and to perish
to the last man sooner than submit
to be taken back to camp and flogged
to death by the Russians.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were fourteen men in all.
Some had suffered from fever; others
were debilitated by bad nourishment.
But the burning desire for liberty, and
dread of the fate which awaited us
in case of failure, gave vigour to our
limbs. We marched for thirteen
nights without intermission. By
day we concealed ourselves in the
forests; during the darkness we sometimes
risked ourselves in the vicinity
of the roads. When the provisions
we had in our knapsacks were exhausted,
we supported ourselves partly
with the berries we found in the
woods, and partly with half-raw
game. Fortunately, there was no
want of deer in the woods. Towards
evening we dispersed in quest of
them, but ventured to fire at them
only when very near, in order not to
squander our ammunition and betray
our hiding-place to the Cossack
piquets. For this latter reason we
dared not light a fire at night, preferring
to suffer from cold, and to devour
the flesh of the slain beasts in a
half-raw state.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After our thirteen nights’ wanderings,
we had reached the neighbourhood
of the river Arpatschai, but
did not rightly know where we were.
From the high and barren mountain
peaks on which we lay, we beheld, in
the far distance, the houses of a large
town. We knew not whether it was
Russian or Turkish. Without knowledge
of the country, without a compass,
without intercourse with the
inhabitants, whom we anxiously
avoided, because we constantly feared
discovery and betrayal, we roamed at
random in the mountains, ignorant
what direction we should take to
reach the frontier. Latterly the chase
had been unproductive, and we suffered
from hunger, as well as from
fatigue and severe cold. We saw a
herd of wild goats upon the heights,
but all our attempts stealthily to
approach them were unsuccessful;
with extraordinary swiftness they
scoured across the fields of snow
which covered those lofty mountains,
and we lost a whole day in a fruitless
pursuit. The sharp mountain air, the
toilsome march on foot, increased our
hunger. Driven almost to despair,
we resolved to run a risk and approach
the first village we saw, calling
to mind the oath we had taken to
defend ourselves to the last drop of our
blood, and rather to put each other to
death than to fall alive into the hands
of the Russians.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On the upper margin of the forest
we discovered the minarets of a Tartar
mosque. At dusk we cautiously
approached and fell in with two Tartars,
cutting bushes. From them we
learned that we were about thirty
versts from the town of Gumri, where
the Russians were building a great
fort. The frontier was but a short
day’s journey distant, and the long
blue line which we had seen from the
mountain tops was really the river
Arpatschai, whose farther bank is
Turkish. We did not conceal from
the Tartars our condition and design.
The state of our uniforms, all torn by
the brambles, and our wild hungry
aspect, would hardly have allowed us
to be taken for Russian soldiers on
service, and they had at once recognised
us for what we were. Mindful
of the advice of the old Tartar at
Manglis, we told them it was our firm
resolution to become good Mahometans
as soon as we got to Turkey.
We adjured them, in the name of
Allah and the Prophet, to send us
provisions from the village, into which
they themselves advised us not to
venture. According to their account,
there was a Cossack post in the
neighbourhood, and the banks of the
Arpatschai were, they assured us, so
strictly watched by Russian piquets,
that there was little hope of our getting
across the frontier in that direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At a rapid pace, the Tartars returned
to their village. One of our
party, well acquainted with the Tartar
tongue, followed them, concealing
himself behind the bushes, in order to
overhear, if possible, their conversation,
and to satisfy himself whether
they were honest people, in whom we
might confide. But the Tartars exchanged
not a word upon their way
home. In an hour they came to us
again, bringing three other men, one
of whom wore a white turban. As
they passed before some brushwood in
which our comrade lay concealed, he
heard them in animated conversation.
Following them stealthily through the
thicket, he caught enough of their
discourse to ascertain that they were
of different opinions with respect to
the line of conduct to be adopted with
respect to us. One of them, who, as
we subsequently learned, had served
at Warsaw in Prince Paskewitch’s
Oriental body-guard, would at once
have informed the Cossacks of our
hiding-place. But the man in the
white turban sought to restrain him,
and wished first to speak with us.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Tartars found us at the appointed
place. The White Turban
was a Mollah, a fine grey-haired old
man with a venerable countenance.
To him we frankly confided the history
of our sufferings and the object we
had in view. After hearing us, he
remained for some time buried in
thought. To our great surprise one
of the Tartars now addressed us in
broken Polish, and told us that he
had been at Warsaw. At this we were
so overjoyed that we were near embracing
the man. But the comrade
we had sent out to reconnoitre had
rejoined us. He seized the Tartar
furiously by the beard, upbraided him
with the treacherous advice he had
given to his countrymen, and threatened
to kill him. The old Mollah
interfered as peacemaker, and assured
us of his assistance and protection,
if it were seriously our intention
to escape into Turkey and become
converts to the creed of Mahomet.
We protested that such was our design,
although we mentally prayed to
our God and to the Virgin to forgive
us this necessary lie, for our design
was to escape from the Russian hell,
but not to become faithless to our holy
religion. Before the Mollah departed,
he had to swear by his beard and by
the Prophet that he would not betray
us. We made the others take the
same oath. The ex-life-guardsman
we proposed keeping as a hostage.
But the Mollah begged us not to do
so, and to trust to his word, which
he pledged for the man’s silence.
Above all we wanted provisions.
The Tartars had unfortunately come
empty-handed. The pangs of hunger
almost drove us to accompany them
into the village. But the Mollah
warned us that we should there find
families of Armenian peasants, who
would certainly betray us to the Russians.
Fluctuating between hope and
fear, we saw them depart. The Mollah’s
last advice was to be vigilant
during the night, since our presence
might have been observed by others,
who might report it to the Russians.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two heavy hours went by.
Night had set in, and the stillness
was broken only by the occasional
howling of the village dogs. As the
distance to the village was not great,
and as the Mollah had so positively
promised to send us food immediately,
our suspicions were again aroused, and
we mutually reproached each other
with having been so foolish as to trust
to the oaths of the Tartars and with
having suffered them all to depart,
instead of keeping the Mollah and the
Warsaw man as hostages. Taking
our muskets, we stationed ourselves
upon the look-out. Our apprehensions
were not unfounded. Soon we
heard through the darkness the neighing
of horses and distant voices. Those
of our comrades who were strongest
on their legs went out to reconnoitre,
and came back with the terrible intelligence
that they had plainly distinguished
the voices of Russians. Meanwhile
the noise of horses’ feet died
away; once more all was still as the
grave; and even the vigilant dogs
seemed sunk in sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Before the first grey of morning
appeared, one of the Tartars whom
we had met the day before, in the
wood, came to us, with three others
whom we had not yet seen. They
brought us a great dish of rice, and
half a roasted lamb; also bread and
fruit. Our presence in the neighbourhood,
they said, had been disclosed to
the Russians by an Armenian of the
village. The Cossack captain had
sent for the Mollah and threatened
him, but the old man had revealed
nothing. The Cossacks did not know
our exact hiding-place, and one of
the Tartars had led them in a wrong
direction. As we were already considered
as Mahometans, no Tartar would
betray us, unless it were that man
who had been in Warsaw, and who
was an object of contempt with the
people of the village on account of
his dissolute and drunken habits.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our fierce hunger appeased, our
spirits and courage revived, and we
decided to continue our march at once.
The Tartars advised us not to cross
the Arpatschai, which was too closely
guarded by the Russian frontier
piquets, but to move more northwards,
across the mountains of Achalziche,
in which direction we should
find it far easier to reach Turkish
territory. We bade them a grateful
farewell. But with the first beam
of morning we heard the wild hurra
of the Cossacks and saw them in the
distance, galloping, accompanied by
a number of Tartar horsemen, to cut
us off from the valley. We drew back
amongst the bushes, and fired a full
volley at the nearest group of horsemen,
as it tried to force its way into
the thicket. Two Cossacks and a Tartar
fell, and the rest took to a cowardly
flight. We retreated forthwith to the
mountain summits whence we had so
recently descended, and did not even
wait to search the fallen men. Soon
a single horseman rode towards us,
waving a green branch. We recognised
one of the Tartars who had
brought us food. He said that the
Mollah was at the old place in the
wood, and wished to speak with us.
We had nothing more to fear from the
Cossacks. They took us to be twice
as numerous as we really were, had
returned to their post and sent to
Gumri for reinforcements, which could
not arrive before evening. Observing
that we harboured mistrust, the man
offered to remain as a hostage. I and
three of my comrades went to the appointed
place. The others remained
on the mountain, with the Tartar in
custody. The Mollah was really
waiting for us, with two of the men
who had accompanied him the previous
evening. We learned, to our
astonishment, that the Tartar whom
we had shot was the same old soldier
who had been at Warsaw and
had spoken Polish to us. We held
this to be a judgment of God. For,
notwithstanding his oath, the man
had betrayed our hiding-place to the
Russians, who were already aware of
our vicinity. The other villagers had
been compelled to mount and follow
the Cossacks, but, at the first volley,
gladly joined the latter in their flight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Mollah gave the unfortunate
Poles directions as to the road, and as
to how they should act if they fell
into the hands of the Pasha of Kars,
who was well disposed towards Russia,
and might deliver them up through
fear or greed of gain. All that day
they toiled over the rude mountain
peaks, and next morning they were
so lucky as to kill a wild goat; but on
those barren heights not a stick of
wood was to be found, and they had to
eat the flesh raw. After a few hours’
rest they continued their arduous
journey. It was bitterly cold, the snow
fell in thick flakes, and a cutting wind
beat in their faces. Towards evening,
guided by a light, they reached the
wretched huts of some poor Russian
frontier settlers, who were cooking
their food over fires of dried cow-dung.
From these people they obtained
meat and drink, gave them the
few kopeks they had left, which they
knew would not pass current in
Turkey, and departed, their flasks
filled with brandy, and bearing with
them the best wishes of their poor but
hospitable entertainers. Their march
next day was through a dense fog,
which covered the high ground. They
could not see ten paces before them,
and risked, at every step, a fall over
a precipice. On the other hand, they
flattered themselves that they could
pass the frontier—there marked by
the mountain chain—unseen by the
Russian troops. To guard against
smuggling and the plague, as well as
against military desertion and the
flight of the natives into Turkey, the
frontier line had latterly been greatly
strengthened. But, once on the
southern slope of the mountains, the
fugitives had been assured, they
would meet no more Cossacks and
would be on Turkish ground. Accordingly
they gave themselves up to unbounded
joy at being out of Russia
and of danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How great was our horror,” continued
Saremba, “when, on descending
into the valley, the fog lifted, and
we found ourselves close to a post of
Cossacks. It was too late to retreat.
We marched forward in military
order, keeping step as upon parade.
The stratagem succeeded. The Cossack
sentinel took us for a Russian
patrol. We surrounded the house,
made prisoners of the sentry and of
seven half-drunken Cossacks, and
learned from them that in the fog we
had missed our way over the frontier.
The piquet was thirty men strong, but
two and twenty had marched that
very day on patrol duty. The report
of our flight had been received from
Gumri, as well as information that
the Cossacks should be reinforced by
a detachment of infantry. The sentry
had taken us for this expected detachment.
We were well pleased with
the issue of our adventure. The contents
of the Cossacks’ larder revived
and strengthened us, and we packed
the fragments of the feast in our
knapsacks. We also took their horses,
and finally, at their own request
bound them hand and foot; for, now
that they were sober, they trembled
for the consequences of having allowed
themselves to be surprised and unresistingly
overpowered. They anticipated
a severe punishment, and consulted
together how they should best
extenuate their fault. The dense
morning fog was a good circumstance
to plead, and so was our superiority
of numbers, and also the expectation
of a Russian infantry piquet from
Gumri. But when all was said, the
poor fellows were still pretty sure to
get the stick. At their request we
fastened the door of the piquet-house
before marching away with our booty.
That afternoon we crossed the mountains,
and reached, without further
adventure, a Turkish military post.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sufferings and disasters of these
fourteen hardy Poles were not yet at
an end. After their arms had been
taken from them, their arrival was
reported to the Pasha of Kars, to
whom the Russian commandant at
Gumri forthwith sent a threatening
letter, demanding the bodies of the
fugitives. Four days of anxious suspense
ensued, during which orderlies
rode to and fro, carrying the correspondence
between the Pasha and the
commandant, and at last the Poles
were told that their only chance to
avoid being delivered up was instantly
to become Mahometans. In this perplexity
they accepted the secret offer
of the son of a Lasistan bey to aid
their flight into the Pashalik of Trebizond.
They started in the night
with a caravan of armed mountaineers.
On the first day they were
divided into two parties, which were
separated from each other. On the
second day, four, out of the six who
were with Saremba, disappeared,
although they entreated to be left
together. Finally, when Saremba
awoke upon the third morning, he
found himself alone. Thus torn from
the true and steadfast friends in whose
brave companionship he had faced
and surmounted so many perils, his
courage deserted him; he wept aloud,
and cursed his fate. There was good
cause for his grief when he came to
know all. The rascally Turk who
had facilitated their flight had sold
them into slavery. For six months
Saremba toiled under a cruel taskmaster,
until fever robbed him of his
strength; when his owner, Ali Bey,
took him to Trebizond, where the
Pole had invented the existence of a
brother who would pay his ransom.
There he obtained the protection of
the French consul, was forwarded to
Constantinople, married a Greek
woman, and managed to eke out an
existence. Of the thirteen comrades
who had fled with him from Manglis
he had never seen or heard anything,
and tears fell upon the honest fellow’s
weather-beaten moustache as he deplored
their probable fate—that of
numbers of Polish deserters, who drag
out a wretched existence, as slaves to
the infidel, in the frontier provinces of
Asiatic Turkey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr Wagner found his follower’s
narrative so striking, and so illustrative
of the characteristics of the inhabitants
of the trans-Caucasian
frontier, that he at once wrote it
down in his journal; and he did quite
right, for certainly Saremba’s adventures
equal, if they do not exceed, in
interest, any of the Doctor’s own.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Gumysh Haneh, the next
town on the road to Erzroum is
Baiburt, once noted for its inhabitants’
fanaticism and hatred of all
Europeans. Poverty, misery, and the
visit of the Russians in 1828, have
broken their spirit, and humbled
them to the dust. Theirs was the
last effort of resistance against Paskewitch,
but all their fierce fanaticism
did not qualify them to cope with
the well-drilled Russian troops. “Is
it true,” asked Saremba, with a little
irony in his tone, of a white-bearded
Turk, in the expression of whose hard
and furrowed features something of
the old spirit was still plainly to be
read—“is it true that the <em>Moskof</em>
has come as far as this?” “<em>Geldi!</em>”
(he came) was the old man’s laconic
but melancholy reply. At Baiburt
the traveller has a foretaste of the
impoverished, decayed, half-ruined
towns which extend thence through
the whole of Asiatic Turkey to the
Persian frontier, and to whose deplorable
condition Erzroum constitutes
the sole exception. Journeying
south-east from Baiburt to the latter
city, the first day’s march brings
the traveller, by the usual caravan
road, to no regular halting-place for
the night. At Baiburt Dr Wagner
parted from his Turkish travelling
companions, and proceeded with only
Saremba and a horse-guide, “a man
of most horrible physiognomy, who
professed to be a Turk, but whose
long distorted visage, great crooked
nose, bushy brows, dingy complexion,
puffy turban, and ragged
clothes, gave him more the look of
a Kourd or Yezidee. The fellow
spoke a Turkish,” continues the Doctor,
“of which I understood nothing,
and my servant, although well acquainted
with the language of Stamboul,
but little. He was very taciturn,
and replied to the questions I
occasionally put to him by croaking
out inarticulate guttural sounds, something
between the cry of a screech-owl
and the snarl of a jackal. Then
he twisted his ugly face so strangely,
and grinned and ground his teeth
in so hyena-like a fashion, that I
was reminded of that horrible Texas
Bob, whom Charles Sealsfield, in his
Cabin-Book, has so graphically
sketched.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The most unsuspicious and confiding
of men, Dr Wagner here remarks,
will become mistrustful, and prone
to suspect evil, before he has been
long a resident or rambler in the
East, and will acquire a habit of
constant caution and vigilance in a
country where all classes, from the
Pasha to the horse-keeper, lay themselves
out to plunder and overreach
Europeans. The Doctor had been
for three years wandering in Oriental
lands, where he had encountered
some perils and innumerable attempts
at imposition. He was much
upon his guard, and kept a sharp
eye upon his hyena-looking guide,
especially when the latter, under
pretence of conducting him to quarters
for the night, struck off from
the road, and led him over crag and
fell, through rain and darkness, into
a wild, cut-throat district, where he
every moment expected to be handed
over to the gentle mercies of a band
of Kourd brigands. Putting a pistol
to the fellow’s ugly head, the Doctor
swore he would shoot him at the
first sign of treachery. The Turk
said nothing, but presently—“Here
is the village,” he quietly remarked,
as he led the drenched travellers
round the angle of a mass of rock,
whence they perceived the lights of
the village of Massat, where Hamilton
had passed a night some years
previously, and where they soon
were comfortably seated by a fire,
and supping on a very tolerable
pilau; whilst Dr Wagner was fain
to atone for his ill-founded suspicions
by a double <em>bakshish</em> to his uncouth
but trustworthy guide. The next
day, the Doctor, whilst riding over
the mountains with loaded pistols
in his belt, and a double gun across
his shoulders, fell over a precipice
nearly a hundred feet high. The
soil of a narrow ledge, softened by
the rain, had given way under his
horse’s feet. Man and beast rolled
over and over five or six times in
the course of the descent. Fortunately
there were no rocks in the
way—nothing but soft earth. They
reached the bottom bruised and bleeding,
but without broken bones, and
were able to continue their march.</p>

<p class='c008'>The journey from Erzroum to
Persia, through the Alpine district
of Armenia, is usually made with
a caravan or with post-horses—more
rarely in company with a Tartar in
the employ of the Turkish government,
who rides courier-fashion,
changes his horse every four or five
leagues, goes at a gallop, never rests
for more than an hour, rides many
horses to death, and performs the
distance from Erzroum to Tabriz
(nearly a hundred leagues) in the extraordinarily
short time of two days
and a half. Dr Wagner had no taste for
travelling in such true Tartar fashion.
Would he go post? There are no
postmasters in Turkey, nor post-horses,
nor posting-stables, nor even
postilions, properly so called. Posting
in the East has nothing in common
with European posting. But on presentation
of a firman from the Sublime
Porte or the Pasha of the province,
every town or village is bound to
supply the traveller with the needful
horses, and with a horse-guide, at moderate
charge. The expense is greatly
augmented by the necessity of being
accompanied by a Turkish cavass.
Without such escort the journey from
Erzroum to the Persian frontier is
unsafe, and, even with it, all danger
is not removed; for in the neighbourhood
of the Alpine passes of
Armenia lurk the lynx-eyed Kourds,
watching for prey. Less daring and
dangerous than they were, they are
still sufficiently audacious. When
pursued by the Pashas—who occasionally
make expeditions, at the
head of bodies of the Nizam soldiery,
to chastise them, and to wrench from
them their booty—they take refuge
upon Persian ground, send a present
to the Sardar of Tabriz, and are
suffered to pasture their flocks
amongst the mountains of Azerbijan,
until they again give way to
their predatory propensities, and are
threatened or pursued by the Persian
authorities. Over the rugged summits
of the Agri Dagh they then fly
to Russian territory, where the gift
of a horse to the Cossack officer
in command usually procures them
tolerance upon the grassy slopes of
Ararat. When driven thence, for a
repetition of their lawless raids, they
have still a last refuge in the high
mountains of Kourdistan, where they
purchase the protection of a chief,
and whose inaccessible fastnesses
defy Turkish pursuers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not long before my departure
from Erzroum,” says Dr Wagner,
“Mr Abbott, the English consul at
Teheran, had fallen into the hands
of Kourd robbers, and, with his
travelling companions, had been
stripped to the shirt, inclusively.
It was a serio-comic affair. They
were attacked near Diadin. Mr
Abbott, a man of great personal courage,
fired a pistol at the first Kourd
who rode at him with his long bamboo
lance, and missed—fortunately
for him, for had he killed or wounded
him, his own life would assuredly have
paid the penalty. Two vigorous lance
thrusts, which fortunately pierced his
<em>burka</em>, not his body, cast the courageous
Briton from his horse. His
Oriental servants and companions had
no portion of his combative spirit,
but laid down their arms, terrified by
the jackal-like yells and hideous figures
of the Kourds. The robbers were
tolerably generous, after their manner.
They took away horses, baggage, and
clothes, stripping their victims stark
naked, but they left them their lives.
And if Mr Abbott had a taste of lance
staves and horse-whip, that was only
in requital of the pistol-shot. His
Armenian servants, who resisted not,
received no injury. Amidst the infernal
laughter of the Kourds, the
naked travellers set off for the nearest
village, where they were scantily provided
with clothes by compassionate
Armenians. Consul Brant at Teheran
made a great noise about this business,
and the Pasha had to make compensation.
But the Kourds retreated
southwards to the high mountains,
and there, in inaccessible hiding-places,
laughed alike at the British
consul’s anger, and at the Turkish
Pasha’s threats.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With such a warning before him, Dr
Wagner preferred adopting the safest,
and at the same time the most convenient,
although the slowest mode of travelling
in those regions—namely, per
caravan. Almost weekly a commercial
caravan starts from Erzroum for
Tabriz. It consists of from 300 to 900
horses, laden chiefly with English manufactures,
also with Bohemian glass,
furs, and cloth from the Leipzig fair,
and even with toys from Nuremberg.
If the convoy be particularly valuable,
the Pasha sends with it a cavass, who
rides a head, a horse’s tail at the end
of his long lance, as a warning to predatory
Kourds not to meddle with
that which is under the high protection
of the <em>muschir</em> of Erzroum. But
the caravan’s own strength is its best
protection. There is a man to every
three or four horses, armed with a
gun, often with sabre and dagger also;
and the Armenians, although tame
enough in general, will fight fiercely
for their goods, or for those intrusted
to their care. Of course there is no
security against nocturnal theft, at
which the Kourds are as skilful as
North-American red-skins, or as the
Hadjouts of the African Metidja.</p>

<p class='c008'>A rich Armenian, by name Kara
Gos, (Black-eye,) led the caravan to
which Dr Wagner annexed himself.
Half the 360 horses comprising it were
his. A considerable rogue was Kara
Gos, who asked the Doctor double the
fair price for the use of six horses, a
place under the principal tent, and
daily rations from his kitchen. When
the Doctor pointed out the overcharge,
Kara Gos turned away in silence and
in dudgeon, and spoke no word to him
during the whole journey. Dr Wagner
made his bargain with another
Armenian, one Karapet Bedochil, and
the journey was prosperously accomplished
in twenty-seven days from
Erzroum to Tabriz. This was rather
slow work—scarcely twelve miles a-day
on an average; but Dr Wagner
was well pleased to have leisure during
the long hours of repose—rendered
necessary by hot weather and scanty
pasturage—to pursue his geological researches,
to go shooting, and to collect
rare insects and beautiful Alpine
plants. He took interest, also, in
observing the habits and intelligence
of the horses of the caravan. These
were as disciplined as any Russian
soldiers, and understood their duty
almost as well as their human masters.
When, at two in the morning,
the Karivan-Baschi gave the signal to
march, they responded by a general
neighing, snorting, and tinkling of the
bells hung to their necks. Notwithstanding
the thick darkness, every
horse found his right place, his owner,
and his groom, and stood motionless
till pack-saddle and bales were placed
upon his back. The load duly balanced,
he instantly started off of his
own accord. The march was in file,
two abreast. The oldest and most
experienced horse took the lead, seemingly
proud of the distinction, and
displaying an instinct almost amounting
to reason. No danger was there
of <em>his</em> going astray, or shying at some
oddly-shaped rock, dimly seen through
the twilight, or at a corpse upon the
road, or even at the passage of camels,
to which horses have a special antipathy.
If stream or torrent barred
the way, he halted, unbidden, until
the nearest horseman had sought out
a ford, and then calmly entered the
water, his example giving confidence
to his followers. These caravan horses
love society, soon attach themselves
to their companions, whether biped or
quadruped, but are very inhospitable,
and do not easily admit strange horses
to their company. They dislike separation
from the caravan, just as cavalry
chargers often object to leave the
ranks. Karapet Bedochil gave up his
best and youngest horse to Dr Wagner
for the journey. This was a well-shaped
brown mare, of excellent paces,
and easy to govern, so long as her
habits were respected. But it took
some time to accustom her to quit the
caravan, and carry Dr Wagner on his
rambles off the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To ride in the rank and file of a
caravan,” says the Doctor, “is wearisome
enough. When morning dawned,
and the first sunbeams illumined the
green Alpine plateau, I loved to ride
up some rising ground by the wayside,
to contemplate the landscape, and to
enjoy the picturesque aspect of the
Kourd camps, and of the long-line of
the caravan. My horse did not share
my enjoyment. Much spurring did it
cost me to habituate him to even a
few minutes’ separation from his
friends. Love of society, and aversion
to solitude, are amongst the most
striking and affecting characteristics
of these animals. At times I remained
behind the caravan, when I
found an interesting spot, where the
geological formation or the mountain
vegetation invited to examination and
collection. My horse, well secured
near at hand, kept his gaze immovably
fixed upon the vanishing caravan.
When the last straggler had disappeared,
he still pricked up his ears so
long as he could hear the bells.
When these were no longer audible,
he drooped his head, and looked inquiringly
and reproachfully at his
botanising rider. If it cost me trouble
to detach him from the caravan, he
needed no urging to rejoin it. Suddenly
displaying the fire of the Oriental
courser, he galloped with winged
swiftness, till the bells were once more
heard, and broke into loud and joyous
neighings on again joining his
friends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The gregarious and sociable propensities
of Armenian horses are a
great obstacle to the designs of the
Kourd thieves, who at nightfall prowl
around the camp. To lessen the
difficulty they come mounted upon
stolen caravan horses, which they
train to the work. A noose is flung
round the neck of a grazing horse,
and whilst one thief pulls the animal
along, another drives it with a whip.
The Armenian horse-keepers fire their
guns to give the alarm, and mount
their best horses to pursue the
marauders. If they overtake them,
they at first endeavour to obtain
restitution by fair words or by threats.
Only at the last extremity do they
use their firearms, for they have a
not unfounded fear of Kourd vengeance
for bloodshed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Less dreaded, and far less frequent
than these depredations, are attacks
upon caravans by wolves. These
occur scarcely once in ten years, and
then only in very severe winters,
when long frosts keep the flocks from
the pastures. Under such circumstances,
the wolves, spurred by extreme
hunger, sometimes overcome
their natural cowardice, and make a
dash at a caravan, breaking suddenly
into the column on the march, pulling
down horses, and tearing them in
pieces, before there is time to drive
them away with bullets. But these
cases are of extremely rare occurrence.
It more often happens that, in summer,
a single wolf will sneak down
upon the grazing caravan horses,
whose instinct, however, soon detects
his approach. They form a circle,
heads inwards and heels out, and if the
wolf does not succeed, at a first spring,
in fixing upon one of their throats,
his best plan is to decamp, before he
gets shot. The attacks of these wolves
are always nocturnal. From other
beasts of prey the caravans between
Erzroum and Tabriz have nothing to
fear. The jackals are weak and timid,
and content themselves with dead
horses; and bears are few in number,
and confine their feeding to sheep and
goats. Southwards from Tabriz to
Teheran, and thence to Ispahan, the
danger increases. Kourds are replaced
by Turkomans; wolves by panthers
and tigers. But even from these,
so far as Dr Wagner could gather from
repeated conversations with caravan
leaders, the peril is trifling, except far
south, towards Shiraz, or eastwards in
the deserts of Khorassan, where tigers
are more numerous and aggressive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of other animals accustomed to follow
caravans, the Doctor particularly
mentions ravens and carrion birds,
which in winter consume the excrement,
in summer the carcasses, of
horses. In Armenia and Persia, he
recognised an old friend whom he had
often seen hovering over the expeditionary
column which he had accompanied
to Constantina. The white-headed
vulture (<em>Vultur fulvus</em>) floated
in the air at a prodigious height above
the caravan, and as often as a horse
fell dead, dozens of the loathsome
birds lowered their powerful pinions,
and sank plumb-down upon the carrion.
The beasts of the caravan, even
the dogs, were pretty good friends
with these obscene creatures; or at
least, from the force of habit, usually
endured their proximity. Dr Wagner
speculates on the possibility of some
eccentric sympathy between the horse
and his future coffin. He often saw
the little carrion kite (<em>Cathartes percnopterus</em>,)
when it had gorged itself
with the flesh of some dead animal,
settle down, its feathers all puffed out,
upon a horse’s back, there to digest its
copious meal—a process which the
horse, by his immobility, seemed studiously
to avoid disturbing. Grouped
together in the great heat, from which
they sought to shelter their heads
under their neighbours’ bellies, the
horses stood, each one with his
plumed and impure rider. “Sometimes,”
says the Doctor, “I saw ravens
sitting in the same confidential manner
upon the backs of horses and dromedaries.
In North Africa I observed
similar intimacy between kites and
cows, ravens and swine. Dr Knoblecher
relates that in the Nile districts
of Central Africa he often saw waterfowl,
particularly herons and ibises,
sit upon the backs of elephants. Only
to one kind of animal has the Armenian
caravan-horse a natural hatred
and strong aversion—namely, to the
camel, who, on his side, detests the
horse. Even in caravans composed
of both kinds of beasts, long accustomed
to each other’s presence, this
antipathy endures. Horses and camels,
if left in any degree to their own free
will, go separately to pasture. Long
habit of being together restrains them
from hostile outbreaks, but I never
witnessed, during the whole period of
my Oriental travels, an example of
even a tolerably good understanding
between them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 20th of June—so cold a
morning, that, in spite of cloak and
mackintosh, Dr Wagner was half-frozen—the
caravan reached the
Kourd village of Yendek, and encamped
in a narrow valley, the
mountains around which had been
reckoned, a few years previously,
amongst the most unsafe in Kourdistan,
a caravan seldom passing unassailed.
Towards evening a Kourd
chief came into camp. “He wore
no beard, but thick and long moustaches—as
formerly the Janissaries—a
huge turban, a short <em>burka</em>, very
wide trousers. He had his horse
shod by one of our Armenians, took
a fancy to Karapet-Bedochil’s pocket-knife,
and asked him for it as a keepsake.
He did not pay for the shoeing,
and rode off, with small thanks, amidst
the courteous greetings of all the
Armenians—even of our haughty
Karivan-Baschi. I afterwards laughingly
asked the <em>Kadertshi</em> why he
had not demanded payment from the
Kourd for the shoes and his work.
‘Laugh away!’ was his reply; ‘if
ever you meet that fellow alone, you
won’t be quite so merry.’ The Kourd,
who was armed with pistols, gun,
and sabre, certainly looked the very
model of a captain of banditti.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before reaching Persian territory,
where the risk from robbers diminishes,
some pack-horses were cleverly
stolen by the Kourds; and two
men, who were sent, well mounted,
to overtake the thieves and negotiate
for the restoration of the property,
returned to camp despoiled of clothes
and steeds. Ultimately, the Pasha
of Erzroum extorted the bales from
the Kourds, who are too prudent to
drive things to extremities. But, for
the time, Kara Gos had to pursue his
journey minus his merchandise, and
greatly cast down at the loss, which
he merited for his griping effrontery,
and for the poltroonery with which, a
few days before, he had deviated from
his direct road on the rude demand of
some Kourds, who sought to pick a
quarrel with him—a sort of wolf-and-lamb
business—for riding through
their pastures. He forgot his loss,
however, when reckoning at Tabriz
the full sack of sounding gold tomauns
received for carriage of goods; and
in the joy of his heart he even condescended
to speak to Dr Wagner,
and to extend to him his forgiveness
for having refused to be imposed
upon, so that they parted in amity at
last.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tabriz, in size the second, in population
the first city of the Persian
empire, was the limit of Dr Wagner’s
travels in an easterly direction.
Thence he made excursions; and finally,
turning his steps southwards, made
the circuit of that extremity of Lake
Urumia, and so got back to Bayasid
in Turkish Armenia; so that he visited,
in fact, but a nook of Persia—including,
however, one of its most
important cities and some rarely-explored
districts. His first visit at
Tabriz was to Mr Bonham, the English
consul-general, with whom he
found a Maltese physician, Dr Cassolani—then
the only European medical
man resident in the place—who
offered him, in the kindest manner,
an apartment in his house. Here
Dr Wagner interpolates a gentle
stricture on British hospitality in
Asia. Mr Bonham, he says, “was
certainly also very obliging, but
seemed less hospitable; and although
he had a very roomy house and a
very small family, he, like his colleague,
Mr Brant at Erzroum, was not
fond of putting himself out of his
way. I confess that I have not
formed the most favourable opinion
of English hospitality in the East.
My letters from Lord Aberdeen and
Sir Stratford Canning had not the
effect which might have been reasonably
expected from the high position
of those statesmen. In Russian Asia,
less exalted recommendations generally
procured me a friendly and truly
hospitable reception. On better acquaintance,
and after repeated interviews,
the dry, thoroughly English
reserve and formal manner gave way,
in Mr Bonham, to a certain degree
of amiability. He took a particularly
warm interest in my communications
from the Caucasus, and gave
me in return valuable information
concerning Persian matters. Mr Bonham
was married to a niece of Sir
Robert Peel’s, a beautiful, amiable,
and accomplished lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In Dr Cassolani’s house Dr Wagner
made the acquaintance of a great
number of Persians, who besieged the
learned <em>hekim</em> for advice, and he thus
had excellent opportunities of noting
the peculiarities of Persian character,
manners, and morals. But the most
favourable place for the pursuit of
such studies, on a large scale, he
found to be the Tabriz bazaar,
which is composed of a number of
bazaars, or spacious halls full of
shops. Thither daily repaired Dr
Wagner, escorted by one of Dr Cassolani’s
Persian servants, a fellow of
herculean proportions, whose duty it
was to open a passage through the
curious crowd which at first thronged
round the European. Here were displayed
prodigious masses of merchandise,
chiefly English, only the coarser
kinds of goods coming from Germany
and Russia, glass from Austria, amber
from Constantinople. Here were children’s
watches from Nuremberg, with
a locomotive on the dial, and the inscription,
“Railway from Nuremberg
to Furth;” lithographed likenesses of
the Shah of Persia, taken and printed
in Germany; snuff-boxes from Astrakan,
with the Emperor Nicholas’s
portrait; and portraits of Benkendorf,
Paskewitch, Neidhard, and other
Russian generals distinguished in recent
wars. There were shawls and
carpets from Hindostan, and sabre-blades,
of wonderful temper and finish,
from Shiraz. Of these latter Dr Wagner
saw some, adorned with beautiful
arabesque designs in gold, and inscribed
with passages from the Koran,
whose price was two hundred tomauns,
or Persian ducats. Made of
strips of metal, hammered together
cold, these excellent blades are the
result of prodigious labour, much
time, and great skill. The chief
value of such weapons is usually in
the steel, for the hilt and mounting
must be unusually rich to exceed the
cost of the blade itself. Hitherto the
armourers of Tabriz, Teheran, and
Ispahan have vainly endeavoured to
rival those of Shiraz.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr Wagner soon found himself at
home in the European circle at Tabriz,
which consists chiefly of the
members of the Russian and English
consulates, and of the managers of four
Greek commercial houses, branches
of Constantinople establishments.
The English consul-general, as already
hinted, lived rather retired,
gave a dinner or two each half-year
to the Europeans, and took but small
share in the pleasures and amusements
after which most of them eagerly
ran. An old Greek gentleman,
named Morfopulo, was the great Lucullus
and Amphitryon of the place.
Introduced to him by his Maltese
friend, Dr Wagner was at once cordially
invited to a dinner, which gave
him the first idea of the sumptuous
manner of living of Europeans in Tabriz.
Nothing was spared; Oriental
delicacies were embalmed and ennobled
by the refinements of Western
art. There were fish from the Caspian,
game from the forests of Ghilan,
grapes and mulberries from Azerbijan,
the most exquisite pasties, and the
cream of the vineyards of Champagne
cooling in abundant ice. The guests
were as motley, the talk as various,
as the viands. From East to West,
from Ispahan to Paris, the conversation
rolled. The Russian Consul-general
sketched the Persian court at
Teheran; Dr Cassolani gave verbal
extracts from his life and experience
at Erzroum and Tabriz; an Italian
quack, who had just arrived, and who
had long led a roving existence in
Asiatic Turkey—professing alternately
to discover gold mines, and to heal
all maladies by an infallible elixir—related
his adventures amongst the
Kourds; whilst a young Greek diplomatist,
named Mavrocordato—a relation
of the statesman of that name—just
transferred, to his no small regret,
from Paris to Tabriz, was eloquent
concerning the balls, beauties, and
delights of the French capital.</p>

<p class='c008'>The domestic arrangements of the
European residents in Tabriz are peculiar,
and may possibly account
for the limited nature of the intercourse
maintained with them by
the gentleman who filled the post
of British consul-general at the
time of Dr Wagner’s visit. Some of
the managers of the Greek houses—few
of whom remain more than half-a-dozen
years, which time, owing
to the profitable nature of the trade,
and especially of the smuggling traffic
with the trans-Caucasian provinces of
Russia, usually suffices to make their
fortunes—were married, but had left
their wives in Constantinople. Most
of them, as well as the members of
the Russian consulate-general, were
bachelors. All, however, whether
married or single, had conformed to
the custom of the place, by contracting
limited matrimony with Nestorian
women. This Christian sect, numerous
in Azerbijan, entertains a strong
partiality for Europeans, and has no
scruple, either moral or religious, in
marrying its daughters to them for a
fixed term of years, and in consideration
of a stipulated sum. There is
great competition for a new-comer
from Europe, especially if he be rich.
The queer contract is known in Tabriz
as <i><span lang="it">matrimonio alla carta</span></i>. Very
often the whole of the lady’s family
take up their abode in the house of
the temporary husband, and live at
his charges; and this is indeed often
a condition of the bargain. The usage
is of such long standing amongst
Europeans in Persia, and especially
in that particular province, that it
there scandalises no one. Every
European has a part of his house set
aside for the women, and calls it his
harem: the ladies preserve their Persian
garb and manner of life, cover
their faces before strangers and in the
streets, frequent the bath, and pass
their time in dressing themselves, just
like the Mahomedan Persians. Handsome,
but totally uneducated and unintellectual,
they make faithful wives
and tender mothers, but poor companions.
When the term stipulated in
the contract expires, and if it be not
renewed, they find no difficulty in
contracting permanent marriages with
their own countrymen; the less so,
that, in such cases, they take a dowry
with them, whereas, in general, the
Nestorian has to purchase his wife
from her parents. The children of
the European marriage almost always
remain in possession of the mother;
and Dr Wagner was assured that she
testifies even stronger affection for
them than for those of her second and
more regular marriage; whilst the
stepfather rarely neglects his duty
towards them. “Still more remarkable
is it,” continues the Doctor,
“that the European fathers, when
recalled to their own country, abandon
their children, without, as it
would seem, the slightest scruple of
conscience, to a most uncertain fate,
and trouble themselves no further
concerning them. But a single instance
is known to me, when a
wealthy European took one of his
children away with him. Even in the
case of men otherwise of high character
and principle, a prolonged residence
in the East seems very apt
gradually to stifle the voice of nature,
of honour, and of conscience.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dismissing, with this reflection,
the consideration of European society
and habits in Persia, Dr Wagner
turns his attention to the natives, and
to an examination of the curious incidents
and vicissitudes of modern Persian
history, to which he allots an
interesting chapter—based partly on
his many conversations with British
and Russian diplomatic agents, with
French officers who had served in
Persia, and with French and American
missionaries, partly on the works
of various English travellers—and
then commences his wanderings and
explorations in the mountains of Sahant,
and along the shores of Lake
Urumiah. In these and other investigations,
occupying his second
volume, the length to which our notice
of his first has insensibly extended
forbids our accompanying him, at
least for the present. Judging from
the great number of books relating to

<h3 class='c007'>PART II.—CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class='c014'>“Leddy Kilbrachmont! Weel,
John, my man, she might have done
waur—muckle waur; but I seena
very weel how she could have bettered
hersel. A young, wiselike, gallant-looking
lad, and a very decent lairdship—anither
thing frae a doited auld
man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weel, wife,” said John Stewart,
ruefully scratching his head—“weel,
I say naething against it in itsel;
but will ye tell me what I’m to say
to the Beelye?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, John, that will I,” returned
the house-mother. “Tell him to take
his daughter’s bairn out of its cradle,
puir wee totum, and ask himsel what
<em>he</em> has to do wi’ a young wife—a
young wife! and a bonnie lass like
our Isabell! Man, John, to think,
wi’ that muckle body o’ yours, that
you should have sae little heart! Nae
wonder ye need muckle coats and
plaids about ye, you men! for ne’er
a spark o’ light is in the hearts of ye,
to keep ye warm within.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weel, weel, Isabell; the mair
cause ye should gie me a guid dram
to keep the chill out,” said the miller;
“and ye’ll just mind ye were airt and
pairt, and thought mair of the Beelye’s
bien dwellin’ and braw family than
ever I did; but it’s aye your way—ye
put a’ the blame, when there is blame,
on me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haud your peace, guidman,” said
Mrs Stewart. “Whiles I <em>am</em> drawn
away wi’ your reasonings against my
ain judgment, as happens to folk owre
easy in their temper, whether they
will or no—I’ll no deny that; but
nae man can say I ever set my face
to onything that would have broken
the heart of a bairn of mine. Take
your dram, and gang away with your
worldly thoughts to your worldly
business, John Stewart; if it wasna
for you, I’m sure ne’er a thought of
pelf would enter <em>my</em> head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh, guidwife!” It was all that
the miller’s astonishment could utter.
He was put down. With humility
he took the dram, and softly setting
his glass on the table, went out like
a lamb, to the mill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Leddy Kilbrachmont! and Janet,
the glaikit gilpie, taking up with a
common man!” said Mrs Stewart,
unconsciously pushing aside the pretty
wheel, the offering of the “wright”
in Arncreoch. “Weel, but what
maun I do? If Isabell gangs hame
to her ain house, and Janet—Janet’s
a guid worker—far mair use about
a house like ours than such a genty
thing as Bell—Janet married, too—what’s
to come o’ me? I’ll hae
to bring hame Katie frae the
Castle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Muckle guid ye’ll get of Katie,
mother,” said Janet, who, just then
coming in from the garden, with an
armful of cold, curly, brilliant greens,
had heard her mother’s soliloquy.
“If ye yokit her to the wheel like a
powny, she wadna spin the yarn for
Isabell’s providing in half-a-dozen
years; and no a mortal turn besides
could Katie do in a house, if ye gied
her a’ the land between this and
Kellie Law.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And wha asked <em>your</em> counsel?”
said the absolute sovereign of Kellie
Mill. “If I’m no sair trysted wi’
my family, there never was a woman:
first, your faither—and muckle he
kens about the rule o’ a household;
and syne you, ye taupie—as if Isabell’s
providing was yet to spin! To
spin, said she? and it lying safe in
the oak press up the stair, since ever
Bell was a wee smout of a bairn. And
yours too, though ye dinna deserve
it;—ay, and little Katie’s as weel, as
the bonnie grass on the burnside
could have tellt ye twal year ago,
when it was white wi’ yarn a’ the
simmer through, spun on a purpose-like
wheel—a thing fit for a woman’s
wark—no a toy for a bit bairn. Gae
way wi’ you and your vanities. I
would just like to see, wi’ a’ your
upsetting, ony ane o’ ye bring up a
family as creditable as your mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet stole in to the table at the
further window, and, without a word,
began to prepare her greens, which
were immediately to be added to the
other contents of the great pot, which,
suspended by the crook, bubbled and
boiled over the fire; for the moods of
the house-mother were pretty well
known in her dominions, and no one
dared to lift up the voice of rebellion.</p>

<p class='c008'>After an interval of silence, Mrs
Stewart proceeded to her own room,
and in a short time reappeared, hooded
and plaided, testifying with those
echoing steps of hers, to all concerned,
that she had again put on her high-heeled
gala shoes. Isabell was now
in the kitchen, quietly going about her
share of the household labour, and
doing it with a subdued graceful gladness
which touched the mother’s
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m gaun up to Kellie, Bell, my
woman,” said Mrs Stewart. “I
wouldna say but we may need Katie
at hame; onyway, I’ll gang up to the
Castle, and see what they say about
it. It’s time she had a while at hame
to learn something purpose-like, or it’s
my fear she’ll be fit for naething but
to hang on about Lady Anne; and
nae bairn o’ mine shall do that wi’
my will. Ye’ll set Merran to the
muckle wheel, Isabell, as soon as
she’s in frae the field; and get that
cuttie Janet to do some creditable
work. If I catch her out o’ the house
when I come hame, it’ll be the waur
for hersel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So ye’re aye biding on at the
Castle, Bauby,” said Mrs Stewart, as,
her long walk over, she rested in the
housekeeper’s room, and greeted, with
a mixture of familiarity and condescension,
the powerful Bauby, who
had so long been the faithful friend
and attendant of little Katie Stewart.
“Ye’re biding on? I thought you
were sure to gang with Lady Betty;
and vexed I was to think of ye
gaun away, that my bairn liket sae
weel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll never lee, Mrs Stewart,” said
Bauby, confidentially. “If it hadna
just been Katie Stewart’s sel, and a
thought of Lady Anne, puir thing, left
her lee lane in the house, I would as
soon have gaen out to the May to
live, as bidden still in Kellie Castle.
But someway they have grippit my
heart atween them—I couldna leave
the bairns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aweel, Bauby, it was kind in ye,”
said the miller’s wife; “but I’m in no
manner sure that I winna take Katie
away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take Katie away—eh, Mrs
Stewart!” And Bauby lifted up her
great hands in appeal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ye see her sister Isabell is to be
married soon,” said the important
mother, rising and smoothing down
her skirts. “And now I’m rested,
Bauby, I’ll thank ye to take me to
Lady Anne’s room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fire burned brightly in the west
room, glowing in the dark polished
walls, and brightening with its warm
flush the clouded daylight which shone
through the high window. Again on
her high chair, with her shoulders
fixed, so that she cannot stoop, Lady
Anne sits at her embroidery frame, at
some distance from the window, where
the slanting light falls full upon her
work, patiently and painfully working
those dim roses into the canvass which
already bears the blossoms of many
a laborious hour. Poor Lady Anne!
People, all her life, have been doing
their duty to her—training her into
propriety—into noiseless decorum
and high-bred manners. She has read
the <cite>Spectator</cite> to improve her mind—has
worked embroidery because it was
her duty; and sits resignedly in this
steel fixture now, because she feels <em>it</em>
a duty too—a duty to the world at
large that Lady Anne Erskine should
have no curve in her shoulders—no
stoop in her tall aristocratic figure.
But, in spite of all this, though they
make her stiff, and pale, and silent,
none of these cares have at all tarnished
the gentle lustre of Lady
Anne’s good heart; for, to tell truth,
embroidery, and prejudices, and steel-collars,
though they cramp both body
and mind a little, by no means have
a bad effect—or, at least, by no means
<em>so</em> bad an effect as people ascribe to
them in these days—upon the heart;
and there lived many a true lady
then—lives many a true lady now—to
whom devout thoughts have come
in those dim hours, and fair fancies
budded and blossomed in the silence.
It was very true that Lady Anne sat
there immovable, holding her head
with conscientious firmness, as she
had been trained to hold it, and
moving her long fingers noiselessly as
her needle went out and in through
the canvass before her—very true
that she thought she was doing her
duty, and accomplishing her natural
lot; but not any less true, notwithstanding,
that the heart which beat
softly against her breast was pure
and gentle as the summer air, and,
like it, touched into quiet brightness
by the light from heaven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Near her, carelessly bending forward
from a lower chair, and leaning
her whole weight on another embroidery
frame, sits Katie Stewart, labouring
with a hundred wiles to draw
Lady Anne’s attention from her work.
One of little Katie’s round white
shoulders is gleaming out of her dress,
and she is not in the least erect, but
bends her head down between her
hands, and pushes back the rich golden
hair which falls in shining, half-curled
tresses over her fingers, and laughs,
and pouts, and calls to Lady Anne;
but Lady Anne only answers quietly,
and goes on with her work—for it is
right and needful to work so many
hours, and Lady Anne is doing her
duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>But not so Katie Stewart: her
needle lies idle on the canvass; her
silk hangs over her arm, getting soiled
and dim; and Lady Anne blushes to
remember how long it is since her
wayward favourite began that group
of flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>For Katie feels no duty—no responsibility
in the matter; and having
worked a whole dreary hour, and
accomplished a whole leaf, inclines to
be idle now, and would fain make her
companion idle too. But the conscientious
Lady Anne shakes her head,
and labours on; so Katie, leaning
still further over the frame, and still
more entirely disregarding her shoulders
and deportment, tosses back the
overshadowing curls again, and with
her cheeks supported in the curved
palms of her hands, and her fingers
keeping back the hair from her brow,
lifts up her voice and sings—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Corn rigs and barley rigs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Corn rigs are bonnie.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sweet, clear, and full is little Katie’s
voice, and she leans forward, with her
bright eyes dwelling kindly on Lady
Anne’s face, while, with affectionate
pleasure, the good Lady Anne sits
still, and works, and listens—the
sweet child’s voice, in which there is
still scarcely a graver modulation to
tell of the coming woman, echoing
into the generous gentle heart which
scarcely all its life has had a selfish
thought to interrupt the simple beautiful
admiration of its unenvious love.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Katie, ye little cuttie!” exclaimed
the horror-stricken mother, looking in
at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Katie started; but it was only
with privileged boldness to look up
smilingly into her mother’s face, as
she finished the last verse of her
song.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh, Lady Anne, what can I say
to you?” said Mrs Stewart, coming
forward with indignant energetic
haste; “or what will your ladyship
say to that forward monkey? Katie,
have I no admonished ye to get the
manners of a serving lassie at your
peril, however grand the folk were ye
saw; but, nevertheless, to gie honour
where honour is due, as it’s commanded.
I think shame to look ye in
the face, Lady Anne, after hearing a
bairn of mine use such a freedom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you have no need, Mrs
Stewart,” said Lady Anne, “for
Katie is at home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was the slightest possible
tone of authority in the words, gentle
as they were; and Mrs Stewart felt
herself put down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weel, your ladyship kens best;
but I came to speak about Katie,
Lady Anne. I’m thinking I’ll need
to bring her hame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs Stewart had her revenge.
Lady Anne’s quiet face grew red and
troubled, and she struggled to loose
herself from her bondage, and turn
round to face the threatening visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To take Katie home?—away from
me? Oh, Mrs Stewart, dinna!” said
Lady Anne, forgetting that she was
no longer a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ye see, my lady, our Isabell is to
be married. The young man is Philip
Landale of Kilbrachmont. Ye may
have heard tell of him even in the
Castle;—a lad with a guid house and
plenty substance to take hame a wife
to; and a guid wife he’ll get to them,
though maybe I shouldna say it. And
so you see, Lady Anne, I’ll be left
with only Janet at hame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Mrs Stewart, Katie has not
been accustomed to it; she could not
do you any good,” said the eager, injudicious
Lady Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The very words, my lady—the
very thing I said to our guidman and
the bairns at hame. ‘It’s time,’ says
I, ‘that Katie was learnin’ something
fit for her natural place and lot.
What kind of a wife will she ever
make to a puir man, coming straight
out of Kellie Castle, and Lady Anne’s
very cha’mer?’ No that I’m meaning
it’s needful that she should get a
puir man, Lady Anne; but a bien man
in the parish is no like ane of your
grand lords and earls; and if Katie
does as weel as her mother before
her, she’ll hae a better portion than
she deserves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Indignantly Katie tossed her curls
from her forehead, bent her little
flushed face over the frame, and began
to ply her needle as if for a
wager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Mrs Stewart,” urged Lady
Anne, “Katie’s birthday is not till
May, and she’s only fifteen then.
Never mind the man—there’s plenty
time; but as long as we’re at Kellie,
and not far away from you, Mrs
Stewart, why should not Katie live
all her life with me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Katie glanced up archly, saucily,
but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wouldna be right, my lady.
In the first place, you’ll no be aye at
Kellie; you’ll get folk you like better
than Katie Stewart; and Katie must
depend on naebody’s will and pleasure.
I’ll have it said of nae bairn of
mine that she sorned on a stranger.
Na, she must come hame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Anne’s eyes filled with tears.
The little proud belligerent mother
stood triumphant and imperious before
the fire. The petulant wilful
favourite pouted over her frame; and
Lady Anne looked from one to the
other with overflowing eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My sister Betty’s away, and my
sister Janet’s away,” said Anne Erskine
sadly; “I’ve nobody but Katie
now. If you take Katie away, Mrs
Stewart, I’ll break my heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Katie put away her frame
without saying a word, and coming
silently to the side of the high chair,
knelt down, and looked earnestly into
Lady Anne’s drooping face. There
was some wonder in the look—a little
awe—and then she laid down her soft
cheek upon that hand of Lady Anne’s,
on which already some tears had
fallen, and taking the other hand into
her own, continued to look up with a
strange, grave, sudden apprehension
of the love which had been lavished
on her so long. Anne Erskine’s tears
fell softly on the earnest uplooking
face, and Mrs Stewart’s heart was
melted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weel, Lady Anne, it’s no my nature
to do a hard thing to onybody.
Keep the cuttie; I’ll no seek her as
lang as I can do without her. I gie
ye my word.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The west room is in no respect
changed, though three years have
passed since we saw it last. In the
middle of the room stands a great
open chest, already half full of carefully
packed dresses. This square
flat parcel, sewed up in a linen cover,
which Katie Stewart holds in her arms
as if she could with all her heart throw
it out of the window, instead of depositing
it reverently in the chest, is Lady
Anne’s embroidery; and Lady Anne
herself is collecting stray silks and
needle-books into a great satin bag.
They are preparing for a journey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Anne Erskine is twenty—very
tall, very erect, and with a most
exceptionable carriage. From her
placid quiet brow the hair is combed
up, leaving not so much as one curl
to shelter or shadow a cheek which is
very soft and pale indeed, but which
no one could call beautiful, or even
comely. On her thin arms she wears
long black gloves which do not quite
reach the elbow, but leave a part of
the arm visible under the lace ruffles
which terminate her sleeves; and her
dress is of dark rustling silk, rich and
heavy, though not so spotless and
youthful as it once was. Her little
apron is black, and frilled with lace;
and from its pocket peeps the corner
of a bright silken huswife; for Lady
Anne is no less industrious now than
when she was a girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ah, saucy Katie Stewart! Eighteen
years old, and still no change in you!
No gloves on the round arms which
clasp that covered-up embroidery—no
huswife, but a printed broadsheet
ballad, the floating light literature of
the place and time, in the pocket of
<em>your</em> apron—no propriety in your free
rebel shoulders. And people say there
is not such another pair of merry
eyes in sight of Kellie Law.</p>

<p class='c008'>The golden hair is imprisoned now,
but not so closely as Lady Anne’s,
for some little curls steal lovingly
down at the side, and the fashion of
combing it up clears the open white
forehead, which, in itself, is not very
high, but just in proportion to the
other features of the face. Only a
little taller is the round active figure—a
very little. No one is quite sensible,
indeed, that Katie has made any
advance in stature at all, except herself;
and even herself scarcely hopes,
now in the maturity of eighteen, to
attain another half inch.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the little girlish spirit has been
growing in those quiet years. It was
Spring with her, when Katie saw the
tears of Anne Erskine for her threatened
removal, and her eyes were
opened then in some degree to an appreciation
of her beautiful lot. How
it was that people loved her, followed
her with watchful, solicitous affection—<em>her</em>,
simple little Katie Stewart—the
consciousness brought a strange
thrill into her heart. One may grow
vain with much admiration, but much
love teaches humility. She wondered
at it in her secret heart—smiled over
it with tears—and it softened and
curbed her, indulged and wilful though
she was.</p>

<p class='c008'>But all this time, in supreme contempt
Katie held the rural homage
which began to be paid to her. Simple
and playful as a child in Kellie,
Katie at home, when a young farmer,
or sailor, or prosperous country tradesman,
or all of them together, as happened
not unfrequently, hung shyly
about the fire in the Anstruther Milton,
to which the family had now removed,
watching for opportunities to
recommend themselves, was as stately
and dignified as any Lady Erskine of
them all. For Katie had made up
her mind. Still, “a grand gentleman,”
handsome, courtly, and accomplished,
with titles and honours,
wealth and birth, wandered about, a
gleaming splendid shadow, through
the castles she built every day. To
gain <em>some</em> rich and noble wooer, of
whatever kind proved attainable, was
by no means Katie’s ambition. It
was a superb imagination, which
walked by her side in her dreams,
naturally clothed with the grandeur
which was his due; for Katie’s mind
was not very greatly developed yet—her
graver powers—and the purple of
nobility and rank draped her grand
figure with natural simplicity—a guileless
ideal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Lady Betty’s house a grand
place, Lady Anne?” asked Katie, as
she placed the embroidery in the
chest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s in the High Street,” said
Lady Anne, with some pride; “not
far from the Parliament House, Katie;
but it’s not like Kellie, you know; and
you that have never been in a town,
may think it close, and not like a
noble house to be in a street; but the
High Street and the Canongate are
grand streets; and the house is very
fine too—only Betty is alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Lord Colville no at home,
Lady Anne?” asked Katie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord Colville’s at the sea—he’s
always at the sea—and it’s dreary
for Betty to be left alone; but when
she sees us, Katie, she’ll think she’s
at Kellie again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And would she be glad to think
that, I wonder?” said Katie, half
under her breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Lady Anne did not answer,
for the good Lady Anne was making
no speculations at the moment about
happiness in the abstract, and so did
not properly apprehend the question
of her little friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sound of a loud step hastening
up stairs startled them. Onward it
came thumping through the gallery,
and a breathless voice bore it company,
singing after a very strange
fashion. Voice and step were both
undoubtedly Bauby Rodger’s, and
the gallery creaked under the one,
and the song came forth in gasps
from the other, making itself articulate
in a stormy gust as she approached
the door.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh handsome Charlie Stuart!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oh charming Charlie Stuart!</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s no a lad in a’ the land</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That’s half sae sweet as thou art!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Bauby!” exclaimed Lady Anne
with dignity, as her giant handmaiden
threw open the door—“Bauby, you
have forgotten yourself. Is that a
way to enter a room where I am?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your pardon, my lady—I beg
your pardon—I canna help it. Eh,
Lady Anne! Eh, Miss Katie! ‘Little
wat ye wha’s coming; prince and
lord and a’s coming.’ There’s ane in
the court—ane frae the North, wi’
the news of a’ the victories!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Anne’s face flushed a little.
“Who is it?—what is it, Bauby?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the Prince just, blessin’s on
his bonnie face!—they say he’s the
gallantest gentleman that ever was
seen—making a’ the road frae the
Hielands just ae great conquish. The
man says there’s thousands o’ the
clans after him—a grand army, beginning
wi’ the regular sodgers in
their uniform, and ending wi’ the
braw tartans—or ending wi’ the
clouds mair like, for what twa e’en
could see the end of them marching,
and them thousands aboon thousands;
and white cockauds on ilka bonnet
of them. Eh, my leddy! I could
greet—I could dance—I could sing—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘An somebody were come again,</div>

      <div class='line in8'>Carle an the King come!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, Bauby, hush,” said Lady
Anne, drawing herself up with a consciousness
of indecorum; but her pale
cheek flushed, and her face grew animated.
She could not pretend to indifference.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ye had best get a sword and a
gun, and a white cockade yoursel.
You’re big enough, Bauby,” said the
anti-Jacobite Katie; “for your grand
Chevalier will need a’ his friends yet.
Maybe if you’re no feared, but keep
up with a’ thae wild Hielandmen, he’ll
make you a knight, Bauby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Katie, you forget who’s beside
you,” said Lady Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! ne’er mind me, my lady;
I’m used to argue wi’ her; but if I
did fecht for the Chevalier—ay, ye
may ca’ him sae!—was it no your ain
very sel, Katie Stewart, that tellt me,
nae later than yestreen, that chivalry
meant the auld grand knights that
fought for the distressed lang syne?
And if I <em>did</em> fecht for the Prince, what
should ail me? And if it was the
will of Providence to make me strong
and muckle, and you bonnie and wee,
whase blame was that? The Chevalier!
Ay, and blessings on him!—for
isna he just in the way of the auld
chivalry—and isna he gaun to deliver
the distressed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The way the King did in the
persecuting times—him that shot them
down like beasts, because they liket
the kirk,” said Katie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh, ye little Whig! that I should
say sae! But I have nae call to stand
up for the auld kings—they’ve gaen
to their place, and rendered their
account; but this bonnie lad—for a
bonnie lad he is, though he’s born a
prince, and will dee a great king, as
it’s my hope and desire—has nae
blame of thae ill deeds. He’s come
for his ain kingdom, and justice, and
the rights of the nation, ‘and ilka
man shall hae his ain.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But wha’s wronged, Bauby?”
asked the unbeliever.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wha’s wronged? Isna the nation
wronged wi’ a bit German duke pitten
down in the big seat of our native
king? Isna a’body wronged that has
to suffer that? And isna he coming
with his white cockade to set a’thing
right again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bauby, you forget we’re to leave
Kellie at twelve,” said Lady Anne,
interrupting this conclusive logic,
“and the things are not all ready.
We’ll hear the true news about the
Prince in Edinburgh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll see him, bless him! for he’s
marching on Edinburgh, driving a’
thae cowards before him like a wheen
sheep,” said Bauby, triumphantly.
“I couldna keep the guid news to mysel,
my lady; but now I maun awa.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Bauby hastened from the room,
letting her voice rise as she went
through the gallery, enough to convey
to Katie’s ear her wish—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To see guid corn upon the rigs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And banishment to a’ the Whigs.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After this interruption, the packing
went on busily, and for a considerable
time in silence. It was the memorable
year of Scottish romance—the
“forty-five;” and there were few
hearts on either side which could
keep their usual pace of beating when
the news of the wild invasion was
told. But like all other times of great
events and excitement, the ordinary
platitudes of life ran on with wonderfully
little change—ran on, and wove
themselves about those marvels; so
that this journey to Edinburgh, even
in Lady Anne Erskine’s eyes, at present
bulked as largely, and looked as
important, as the threatened revolution;
and to little Katie Stewart, her
new gown and mantle were greater
events than the advent of the Chevalier.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you no feared to go to Edinburgh,
Lady Anne, and the Chevalier
and a’ his men coming?” asked Katie
at length.</p>

<p class='c008'>Katie’s own eyes sparkled at the
idea, for the excitement of being in
danger was a more delightful thing
than she had ever ventured to anticipate
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Afraid? He is the true Prince,
whether he wins or fails,” said Lady
Anne; “and no lady need fear where
a Stuart reigns. It’s his right he
comes for. I pray Heaven give the
Prince his right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Katie looked up with some astonishment.
Very few things thus moved
the placid Lady Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would only be after many a
man was killed,” said Katie; “and
if the King in London comes from
Germany, this Chevalier comes from
France; and his forefathers were ill
men, Lady Anne.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Katie Stewart,” said Lady Anne,
hastily, “it’s ignorance you’re speaking.
I will not hear it. I’ll hear nothing
said against the right. The
Prince comes of the true royal blood.
He is the son of many good kings;
and if they were not all good, that is
not his fault. My fathers served his.
I will hear nothing said against the
Prince’s right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Katie looked up wonderingly
into her friend’s face, and then turned
away to conclude her packing. But,
quite unconvinced as she was of the
claims and rights of the royal adventurer,
his young opponent said no
more about Prince Charles.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Corn-fields lie under the low green
hills, here bending their golden load
under the busy reaper’s hand, there
shorn and naked, with the gathered
sheaves in heaps where yesterday they
grew. Pleasant sounds are in the
clear rich autumn air—harvest voices,
harvest mirth, purified by a little distance
from all its coarseness; and
through the open cottage doors you
see the eldest child, matronly and important
in one house, idling with a
sense of guilt in the other, who has
been left at home in charge, that all
elder and abler people might get to
the field. Pleasant excitement and
haste touch you with a contagious
cheer and activity as you pass. Here
hath our bountiful mother been rendering
riches out of her full breast
once more; here, under those broad
bright, smiling heavens, the rain and
the sun, which God sends upon the
just and the unjust, have day by day
cherished the seed, and brought it
forth in blade and ear; and now there
is a thanksgiving in all the air, and
quickened steps and cheerful labouring
proclaim the unconscious sentiment
which animates the whole.
Bright, prosperous, wealthy autumn
days, wherein the reaper has no less
share than his master, and the whole
world is enriched with the universal
gain.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now the Firth comes flashing
into sight, making the whole horizon
a silver line, with one white sail, far
off, floating on it like a cloud.
Heavily, as if it overhung the water,
that dark hill prints its bold outline
on the mingled glory of sky and sea;
and under its shadow lie quiet houses,
musing on the beach, so still that you
could fancy them only lingering, meditating
there. But little meditation
is under those humble roofs, for the
fishers of Largo are out on the Firth,
as yonder red sails tell you, straying
forth at the wide mouth of the bay;
and the women at home are weaving
nets, and selling fish, and have time
for anything but meditation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now Largo Law is left behind,
and there is a grand scene beyond.
The skies are clear and distinct as
skies are only in autumn; and yonder
couches the lion, who watches our
fair Edinburgh night and day; and
there she stands herself, his Una,
with her grey wimple over her head,
and her feet on the sands of her vassal
sea. Queenlike attendants these
are: they are almost her sole glory
now; for her crown is taken from her
head, and her new life of genius has
scarcely begun; but none can part
the forlorn queen and her two faithful
henchmen, the Firth and the hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are few other passengers to
cross the ferry with our little party;
for Lady Anne has only one manservant
for escort and protection to
herself, Katie Stewart, and their
formidable maid. In those days
people were easily satisfied with
travelling accommodation. The ferryboat
was a little dingy sloop, lifting
up a huge picturesque red sail to
catch the soft wind, which carried
them along only very slowly; but Katie
Stewart leaned over its grim bulwark,
watching the water—so calm, that it
seemed to have consistence and shape
as the slow keel cut it asunder—softly
gliding past the little vessel’s side,
and believed she had never been so
happy.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was night when they reached
Edinburgh, under the care of a little
band of Lady Colville’s servants and
hangers-on—all the male force the
careful Lady Betty could muster—who
had been waiting for them at the
water-side. The Chevalier’s forces
were rapidly approaching the city,
and Katie Stewart’s heart thrilled
with a fear which had more delight
in it than any previous joy, as slowly
in their heavy cumbrous carriage,
with their little body of adherents,
they moved along through the gloom
and rustling sounds of the beautiful
night. In danger! not unlike the
errant ladies of the old time; and
approaching to the grand centre of
romance and song—the Edinburgh of
dreams.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Colville’s house was in the
High Street, opposite the old Cross
of Edinburgh; and, with various very
audible self-congratulations on the
part of their attendants, the visitors
entered the narrow dark gateway, and
arrived in the paved court within.
It was not very large this court; and,
illuminated by the fitful light of a
torch, which just showed the massy
walls frowning down, with all kinds of
projections on every side, the dwelling-place
of Lady Colville did not
look at all unlike one of the mysterious
houses of ancient story. Here
were twin windows, set in a richly
ornamented gable, sending out gleams
of fierce reflection as the light flashed
into their small dark panes; and
yonder, tier above tier, the great
mansion closes up darkly to the sky,
which fits the deep well of this court
like a roof glowing with its “little
lot of stars.” Katie had time to
observe it all while the good maternal
Lady Betty welcomed her young
sister at the door. Very dark, high,
and narrow was the entrance, more
like a cleft in great black rocks, admitting
to some secret cavern, than a
passage between builded walls; and
the dark masses of shadow which lay
in those deep corners, and the elfin
torchlight throwing wild gleams here
and there over the heavy walls, and
flashing back from unseen windows,
everywhere, made a strange picturesque
scene—relieved as it was by the
clear, faint stars above, and the warm
light from the opened door.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was not at that time the
most peaceful of residences, this house
of Lady Colville’s; for in a day or
two Katie began to start in her high
chamber at the long boom of the
Castle guns; and in these balmy
lightsome nights, excited crowds
paced up and down, from the Canongate
and the Lawnmarket, and
gathered in groups about the Cross,
discussing the hundred rumours to
which the crisis gave birth. At all
times this Edinburgh crowd does
dearly love to gather like waves in
the great street of the old city, and
amuse itself with an excitement when
the times permit. As they sweep
along—knots of old men, slowly
deliberating—clusters of young ones,
quickening their pace as their conversation
and thoughts intensify—all
in motion, continually coming and
going, the wide street never sufficiently
thronged to prevent their passage,
but enough so to secure all the animation
of a crowd; and women
looking on only from the “close
mouths” and outer stairs, spectators
merely, not actors in the ferment
which growls too deeply for them to
join—the scene is always interesting,
always exciting to a stranger; it
loses somehow the natural meanness
of a vulgar mob, and you see something
historical, which quickens your
pulse, and makes your blood warm,
in the angry crowd of the High Street,
if it be only some frolic of soldiers
from the Castle which has roused its
wrath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out, little Katie! out on the round
balcony of that high oriel window—something
approaches which eyes of
noble ladies around you brighten to
see. On the other balcony below
this, Lady Anne, with a white ribbon
on her breast, leans over the carved
balustrade, eagerly looking out for its
coming, with a flushed and animated
face, to which enthusiasm gives a
certain charm. Even now in her
excitement she has time to look up,
time to smile—though she is almost
too anxious to smile—and wave her
fluttering handkerchief to you above
there, Katie Stewart, to quicken your
zeal withal. But there, little stubborn
Whig, unmoved except by
curiosity, and with not a morsel of
white ribbon about her whole person,
and her handkerchief thrown away
into the inner room, least she should
be tempted to wave it, stands the
little Hanoverian Katie, firmly planting
her feet upon the window-sill, and
leaning on the great shoulder of Bauby
Rodger, who thrusts her forward from
behind. Bauby is standing on a
stool within the room, her immense
person looming through the oppressed
window, and one of her mighty hands,
with a handkerchief nearly as large as
the main-sail of a sloop, squeezed up
within it like a ball, ready to be
thrown loose to the winds when he
comes, grasping, like Lady Anne, the
rail of the balustrade.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a brilliant sky overhead,
and all the way along, until the street
loses itself in its downward slope to the
palace, those high-crested coroneted
windows are crowded with the noble
ladies of Scotland. Below, the crowd
thickens every moment—a murmuring,
moving mass, with many minds
within it like Katie Stewart’s, hostile
as fears for future, and remembrance
of past injuries can make them, to
the hero of the day. And banners
float in the air, which high above
there is misty with the palpable gold
of this exceeding sunshine; and distant
music steals along the street, and
far-off echoed cheers tell that he is
coming—he is coming! Pretender—Prince—Knight-errant—the
last of a
doomed and hapless race.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the little boudoir on the
lower story, which this oriel window
lights, Lady Colville sits in a great
elbow chair apart, where she can see
the pageant without, and not herself
be seen; for Lady Betty wisely remembers
that, though the daughter
of a Jacobite earl, she is no less the
wife of a Whig lord, whose flag floats
over the broad sea far away, in the
name of King George. Upon her
rich stomacher you can scarcely
discern the modest white ribbon
which, like an innocent ornament,
conceals itself under the folds of lace;
but the ribbon, nevertheless, is there;
and ladies in no such neutral position
as hers—offshoots of the attainted
house of Mar, and other gentle cousins,
crowd her other windows, though no
one has seen herself on the watch to
hail the Chevalier.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now he comes! Ah! fair,
high, royal face, in whose beauty
lurks this look, like the doubtful
marsh, under its mossy, brilliant
verdure—this look of wandering imbecile
expression, like the passing
shadow of an idiot’s face over the face
of a manful youth. Only at times
you catch it as he passes gracefully
along, bowing like a prince to those
enthusiastic subjects at the windows,
to those not quite so enthusiastic in
the street below. A moment, and all
eyes are on him; and now the cheer
passes on—on—and the crowd follows
in a stream, and the spectators reluctantly
stray in from the windows—the
Prince has past.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Lady Anne still bends over
the balustrade, her strained eyes
wandering after him, herself unconscious
of the gentle call with which
Lady Betty tries to rouse her as she
leaves the little room. Quiet Anne
Erskine has had no romance in her
youth—shall have none in the grave
still life which, day by day, comes
down to her out of the changeful skies.
Gentle affections, for sisters, brethren,
friends, are to be her portion, and her
heart has never craved another; but
for this moment some strange magic
has roused her. Within her strained
spirit a heroic ode is sounding; no
one hears the gradual swell of the
stricken chords; no one knows how
the excited heart beats to their
strange music; but give her a poet’s
utterance then, and resolve that inarticulate
cadence, to which her very
hand beats time, into the words for
which unconsciously she struggles,
and you should have a song to rouse
a nation. Such songs there are; that
terrible Marseillaise, for instance—wrung
out of a moved heart in its
highest climax and agony—the wild
essence and inspiration of a mind
which was not, by natural right, a
poet’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lady Anne! Lady Anne! They’re
a’ past now,” said Katie Stewart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Anne’s hand fell passively
from its support; her head drooped
on her breast; and over her pale cheek
came a sudden burst of tears. Quickly
she stepped down from the balcony,
and throwing herself into Lady
Betty’s chair, covered her face and
wept.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>He’s</em> no an ill man—I think he’s
no an ill man,” said little Katie in
doubtful meditation. “I wish Prince
Charlie were safe at hame; for what
will he do here?”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In Lady Colville’s great drawing-room
a gay party had assembled. It
was very shortly after the Prestonpans
victory, and the invading party were
flushed with high hopes. Something
of the ancient romance softened and
refined the very manners of the time.
By a sudden revulsion those high-spirited
noble people had leaped forth
from the prosaic modern life to the
glowing, brilliant, eventful days of
old—as great a change almost as if
the warlike barons and earls of their
family galleries had stepped out into
visible life again. Here is one young
gallant, rich in lace and embroidery,
describing to a knot of earnest, eager
listeners the recent battle. But for
this the youth had vegetated on his
own acres, a slow, respectable squire—he
is a knight now, errant on an
enterprise as daring and adventurous
as ever engaged a Sir Lancelot or Sir
Tristram. The young life, indeed,
hangs in the balance—the nation’s
warfare is involved; but the dangers
which surround and hem them about
only brighten those youthful eyes, and
make their hearts beat the quicker.
All things are possible—the impossible
they behold before them a thing accomplished;
and the magician exercises
over them a power like witchcraft;—their
whole thoughts turn
upon him—their speech is full of
Prince Charles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Graver are the older people—the
men who risk families, households,
established rank—and whose mature
minds can realise the full risk involved.
Men attainted in “the fifteen,”
who remember how it went with
them then—men whom trustful retainers
follow, and on whose heads
lies this vast responsibility of life and
death. On some faces among them
are dark immovable clouds—on some
the desperate calmness of hearts strung
to any or every loss; and few forget,
even in those brief triumphant festivities,
that their lives are in their hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>In one of those deep window-seats,
half hidden by the curtain, Katie
Stewart sits at her embroidery frame.
If she never worked with a will before,
she does it now; for the little rural
belle is fluttered and excited by the
presence and unusual conversation of
the brilliant company round her. The
embroidery frame just suffices to mark
that Katie <em>is</em> Katie, and not a noble
Erskine, for Lady Anne has made it
very difficult to recognise the distinction
by means of the dress. Katie’s, it
is true, is plainer than her friend’s;—she
has no jewels—wears no white
rose; but as much pains have been
bestowed on her toilette as on that
of any lady in the room; and Lady
Anne sits very near the window, lest
Katie should think herself neglected.
There is little fear—for here he stands,
the grand gentleman, at Katie Stewart’s
side!</p>

<p class='c008'>Deep in those massy walls is the
recess of the window, and the window
itself is not large, and has a frame of
strong broad bars, such as might almost
resist a siege. The seat is
cushioned and draped with velvet, and
the heavy crimson curtain throws a
flush upon Katie’s face. Quickly
move the round arms, gloved with
delicate black lace, which does not
hide their whiteness; and, escaping
from this cover, the little fingers wind
themselves among those bright silks,
now resting a moment on the canvass,
as Katie lifts her eyes to listen to
something not quite close at hand
which strikes her ear—now impatiently
beating on the frame as she droops her
head, and cannot choose but hear
something very close at hand which
touches her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>A grand gentleman!—Manlike and
gallant the young comely face which,
high up there, on the other side of
those heavy crimson draperies, bends
towards her with smiles and winning
looks, and words low-spoken—brave
the gay heart which beats under his
rich uniform—noble the blood that
warms it. A veritable Sir Alexander,
not far from the noble house of Mar in
descent, and near them in friendship;
a brave, poor baronet, young, hopeful,
and enthusiastic, already in eager
joyous fancies beholding his Prince
upon the British throne, himself on
the way to fortune. At first only for
a hasty moment, now and then, can he
linger by Katie’s window; but the
moments grow longer and longer, and
now he stands still beside her, silently
watching this bud grow upon the canvass—silently
following the motion of
those hands. Little Katie dare not
look up for the eyes that rest on her—eyes
which are not bold either, but
have a certain shyness in them; and
as her eyelids droop over her flushed
cheeks, she thinks of the hero of her
dreams, and asks herself, with innocent
wonder thrilling through her
heart, if this is he?</p>

<p class='c008'>The ladies talk beside her, as Katie
cannot talk; shrewdly, simply, within
herself, she judges what they say—forms
other conclusions—pursues quite
another style of reasoning—but says
nothing; and Sir Alexander leans his
high brow on the crimson curtain, and
disregards them all for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaves them all to watch this bud—to
establish a supervision, under which
Katie at length begins to feel uneasy,
over these idling hands of hers. Look
him in the face, little Katie Stewart,
and see if those are the eyes you saw
in your dreams.</p>

<p class='c008'>But just now she cannot look him
in the face. In a strange enchanted
mist she reclines in her window-seat,
and dallies with her work. Words
float in upon her half-dreaming sense,
fragments of conversation which she
will remember at another time; attitudes,
looks, of which she is scarcely
aware now, but which will rise on her
memory hereafter, when the remembered
sunshine of those days begins
to trace out the frescoes on the wall.
But now the hours float away as the
pageant passed through that crowded
High Street yesterday. She is scarcely
conscious of their progress as they
go, but will gaze after them when
they are gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you have no white rose?”
said the young cavalier.</p>

<p class='c008'>He speaks low. Strange that he
should speak low, when among so
many conversations other talkers have
to raise their voices—low as Philip
Landale used to speak to Isabell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Katie.</p>

<p class='c008'>He bends down further—speaks in
a still more subdued tone; while
Katie’s fingers play with the silken
thread, and she stoops over her frame
so closely that he cannot see her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it possible that in Kellie one
should have lived disloyal? But that
is not the greatest marvel. To be
young, and fair, and generous—is it
not the same as to be a friend of the
Prince? But your heart is with the
white rose, though you do not wear it
on your breast?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.” Look up, little Katie—up
with honest eyes, that he may be convinced.
“No; his forefathers were ill
men; and many a man will die first, if
Prince Charles be ever King.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Katie, Katie!” said the warning
voice of Lady Anne, who has caught
the last words of this rebellious speech.
And again the mist steals over her
in her corner; and as the light wanes
and passes away from the evening
skies, she only dimly sees the bending
figure beside her, only vaguely receives
into her dreaming mind the
low words he says. It is all a dream—the
beautiful dim hours depart—the
brilliant groups disperse and go
away; and, leaning out alone from
that oriel window, Katie Stewart
looks forth upon the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now and then passes some late
reveller—now and then drowsily
paces past a veteran of the City Guard.
The street is dark on this side, lying
in deep shadow; but the harvest moon
throws its full light on the opposite
pavement, and the solitary unfrequent
figures move along, flooded in the
silver radiance, which seems to take
substance and tangibility from them,
and to bear them along, floating, gliding,
as the soft waters of the Firth
bore the sloop across the ferry. But
here comes a quick footstep of authority,
echoing through the silent street—a
rustling Highland Chief, with a dark
henchman, like a shadow at his hand;
and that—what is that lingering figure
looking up to the light in Lady Anne
Erskine’s window, as he slowly wends
his way downward to the Palace?
Little Katie’s heart—she had brought
it out here to still it—leaps again; for
this is the same form which haunts her
fancy; and again the wonder thrills
through her strangely, if thus she has
come in sight of her fate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Draw your silken mantle closer
round you, Katie Stewart; put back
the golden curls which this soft breath
of night stirs on your cheek, and lean
your brow upon your hand which
leans upon the sculptured stone.
Slowly he passes in the moonlight,
looking up at the light which may be
yours—which is not yours, little
watcher, whom in the gloom he cannot
see; let your eyes wander after
him, as now the full moonbeams fill
up the vacant space where a minute
since his gallant figure stood. Yes,
it is true; your sunny face shines
before his eyes—your soft voice is
speaking visionary words to that good
simple heart of his; and strange delight
is in the thrill of wonder which
moves you to ask yourself the question—Is
this the hero?</p>

<p class='c008'>But now the sleep of youth falls
on you when your head touches the
pillow. No, simple Katie, no; when
the hero comes, you will not speculate—will
not ask yourself questions;
but now it vexes you that your first
thoughts in the waking morrow are
not of this stranger, and neither has
he been in your dreams.</p>

<p class='c008'>For dreams are perverse—honest—and
will not be persuaded into the
service of this wandering fancy.
Spring up, Katie Stewart, thankfully
out of those soft, deep, dreamless
slumbers, into the glorious morning
air, which fills the street between those
lofty houses like some golden fluid in
an antique well;—spring up joyously
to the fresh lifetime of undiscovered
hours which lie in this new day.
Grieve not that only tardily, slowly, the
remembrance of the last night’s gallant
returns to your untroubled mind;
soon enough will come this fate of
yours, which yet has neither darkened
nor brightened your happy skies of
youth. Up with your free thoughts,
Katie, and bide your time!</p>

<p class='c008'>A visitor of quite a different class
appeared in Lady Colville’s drawing-room
that day. It was the Honourable
Andrew, whose magnificent manners
had awakened Katie’s admiration
at his brother’s marriage. Not a
youth, but a mature man, this Colville
was heir to the lordship; for the good
Lady Betty had no children; and
while the elder brother spent his
prime in the toils of his profession,
fighting and enduring upon the sea,
the younger indolently dwelt at home,
acquiring, by right of a natural inclination
towards the beautiful, the
character of a refined and elegant
patron of the arts. Such art as there
was within his reach, he did patronise
a little; but his love of the beautiful
was by no means the elevating
sentiment which we generally conclude
it to be. He liked to have fine
shapes and colours ministering to his
gratification—liked to appropriate and
collect around himself, his divinity,
the delicate works of genius—liked to
have the world observe how fine his
eye was, and how correct his taste;
and, lounging in his sister-in-law’s
drawing-room, surveyed the dark portraits
on the walls, and the tall erect
Lady Anne in the corner, with the
same supercilious polished smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Betty sits in a great chair,
in a rich dress of black silk, with
a lace cap over her tower of elaborate
hair. She is just entering the autumnal
years; placid, gentle, full of
the sunshine of kindness has been her
tranquil summer, and it has mellowed
and brightened her very face. Less
harsh than in her youth are those
pale lines—softened, rounded by that
kind hand of Time, which deals with
her gently, she uses him so well.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Honourable Andrew, with his
keen eyes, does not fail to notice this,
and now he begins to compliment his
sister on her benign looks; but Lady
Anne is not old enough to be benign,
and her movements become constrained
and awkward—her voice
harsh and unmanageable, in presence
of the critic. He scans her pale face
as if it were a picture—listens when
she speaks like one who endures some
uncouth sounds—is a Whig. Lady
Anne could almost find it in her heart,
gentle though that heart be, to hate
this supercilious Andrew Colville.</p>

<p class='c008'>Loop up this heavy drapery—Katie
Stewart is not aware of any one looking
at her. Her fingers, threaded
through these curls, support her cheek—her
shoulders are carelessly curved—her
other ungloved arm leans upon
the frame of her embroidery, and her
graceful little head bends forward,
looking out with absorbed unconscious
eyes. Now there comes a wakening
to the dreamy face, a start to the still
figure. What is it? Only some one
passing below, who lifts his bonnet
from his bright young forehead, and
bows as he passes. Perhaps the bow
is for Lady Anne, faintly visible at
another window. Lady Anne thinks
so, and quietly returns it as a matter
of course; but not so thinks Katie
Stewart.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Honourable Andrew Colville
changes his seat: it is to bring himself
into a better light for observing
that picture in the window, which,
with a critic’s delight, he notes and
outlines. But Katie all the while is
quite unconscious, and now takes two
or three meditative stitches, and now
leans on the frame, idly musing, without
a thought that any one sees or
looks at her. By and by Mr Colville
rises, to stand by the crimson
curtain where Sir Alexander stood on
the previous night, and Katie at last
becomes conscious of a look of admiration
very different from the shy
glances of the youthful knight. But
Mr Colville is full thirty: the little
belle has a kind of compassionate forbearance
with him, and is neither
angry nor fluttered. She has but
indifferent cause to be flattered, it is
true, for the Honourable Andrew
admires her just as he admires the
magnificent lace which droops over
his thin white hands; but still he is
one of the <em>cognoscenti</em>, and bestows
his notice only on the beautiful.</p>

<p class='c008'>And he talks to her, pleased with
the shrewd answers which she sometimes
gives; and Katie has to rein in
her wandering thoughts, and feels
guilty when she finds herself inattentive
to this grandest of grand gentlemen;
while Lady Betty, looking over
at them anxiously from her great
chair, thinks that little Katie’s head
will be turned.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is in a fair way; for when Mr
Colville, smiling his sweetest smile
to her, has bowed himself out, and
Katie goes up-stairs to change her
dress preparatory to a drive in Lady
Betty’s great coach, Bauby approaches
her mysteriously with a little cluster
of white rosebuds in her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Muckle fash it has ta’en to get
them at this time o’ the year, Miss
Katie, ye may depend,” said the
oracular Bauby; “and ye ken best
yoursel wha they’re frae.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The white rose—the badge of rebellion!
But the little Whig puts it
happily in her breast, and, when Bauby
leaves her, laughs aloud in wonderment
and pleasure; but, alas! only as
she laughed, not very long ago, at this
new black mantle or these cambric
ruffles; for you are only a new plaything,
gallant Sir Alexander, with
some novelty and excitement about
you. You are not the hero.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The little town of Anstruther stands
on the side of the Firth, stretching its
lines of grey red-roofed houses closely
along the margin of the water. Sailing
past its little quiet home-like harbour,
you see one or two red sloops
peacefully lying at anchor beside the
pier. These sloops are always there.
If one comes and another goes, the
passing spectator knows it not. On
that bright clear water, tinged with
every tint of the rocky bed below—which,
in this glistening autumn day,
with only wind enough to ruffle it
faintly now and then, looks like some
beautiful jasper curiously veined and
polished, with streaks of salt sea-green,
and sober brown, and brilliant blue,
distinct and pure below the sun—these
little vessels lie continually, as much
a part of the scene as that grey pier
itself, or the houses yonder of the
twin towns. Twin towns there must
be, as you learn from those two
churches which elevate their little
spires above the congregated roofs.
The spires themselves look as if, up to
a certain stage of their progress, they
had contemplated being towers, but,
changing their mind when the square
erection had attained the form of a
box, suddenly inclined their sides towards
each other, and became abrupt
little steeples, whispering to you recollections
of the Revolution Settlement,
and the prosaic days of William
and Mary. In one of them—or rather
in its predecessor—the gentle James
Melvill once preached the Gospel he
loved so well; and peacefully for two
hundred years have they looked out
over the Firth, to hail the boats coming
and going to the sea-harvest;
peacefully through their small windows
the light has fallen on little
children, having the name named over
them which is above all names; and
now with a homely reverence they
watch their dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>A row of houses, straggling here and
there into corners, turn their faces to
the harbour. This is called the Shore.
And when you follow the line of rugged
pavement nearly to its end, you
come upon boats, in every stage of
progress, being mended—here with a
great patch in the side—there resplendent
in a new coat of pitch, which
now is drying in the sun. The boats
are well enough, and so are the glistering
spoils of the “herring drave;”
but quite otherwise is the odour of
dried and cured fish which salutes you
in modern Anstruther. Let us say
no evil of it—it is villanous, but it is
the life of the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Straggling streets and narrow
wynds climb a little brae from the
shore. Thrifty are the townsfolk,
whose to-morrow, for generations, is
but a counterpart of yesterday. Nevertheless,
there have been great people
here—Maggie Lauder, Professor Tennant,
Dr Chalmers. The world has
heard of the quiet burghs of East and
West Anster.</p>

<p class='c008'>A mile to the westward, on the
same sea-margin, lies Pittenweem,
another sister of the family. Turn
along the high-road there, though you
must very soon retrace your steps.
Here is this full magnificent Firth,
coming softly in with a friendly ripple,
over these low, dark, jutting
rocks. Were you out in a boat yonder,
you would perceive how the folds of
its great garment (for in this calm you
cannot call them waves) were marked
and shaded. But here that shining
vestment of sea-water has one wonderful
prevailing tint of blue; and between
it and the sky, lingers yonder
the full snowy sails of a passing ship;—here
some red specks of fishing-boats
straying down towards the mouth of
the Firth, beyond yon high rock—home
of sea-mews—the lighthouse Isle
of May. Far over, close upon the
opposite shore, lies a mass of something
grey and shapeless, resting like
a great shell upon the water—that is
the Bass; and behind it there is a
shadow on the coast, which you can
dimly see, but cannot define—that is
Tantallon, the stronghold of the stout
Douglases; and westward rises the
abrupt cone of North Berwick Law,
with a great calm bay stretching in
from its feet, and a fair green country
retreats beyond, from the water-side to
the horizon line.</p>

<p class='c008'>Turn now to the other hand, cross
the high-road, and take this footpath
through the fields. Gentle Kellie
Law yonder stands quietly under the
sunshine, watching his peaceful
dominions. Yellow stubble-fields
stretch, bare and dry, over these
slopes; for no late acre now yields a
handful of ears to be gleaned or
garnered. But in other fields the
harvest work goes on. Here is one
full of work-people—quieter than the
wheat harvest, not less cheery—out
of the rich dark fragrant soil gathering
the ripe potato, then in a fresh youthful
stage of its history, full of health
and vigour; and ploughs are pacing
through other fields; and on this
fresh breeze, slightly chilled with
coming winter, although brightened
still by a fervent autumnal sun, there
comes to you at every corner the
odour of the fertile fruitful earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Follow this burn;—it is the same
important stream which forms the
boundary between Anstruther Easter
and Wester; and when it has led
you a circuit through some half-dozen
fields, you come upon a little cluster
of buildings gathered on its side.
Already, before you reach them, that
rustling sound tells you of the mill;
and now you have only to cross the
wooden bridge, (it is but two planks,
though the water foams under it,)
and you have reached the miller’s
door.</p>

<p class='c008'>That little humble cot-house,
standing respectfully apart, with the
miller’s idle cart immediately in front
of it, is the dwelling-place of Robert
Moulter, the miller’s man; but the
miller’s own habitation is more ambitious.
In the strip of garden before
the door there are some rose-bushes,
some “apple-ringie,” and long plumes
of gardener’s garters; and there is a
pointed window in the roof, bearing
witness that this is a two-storied
house of superior accommodation:
the thatch itself is fresh and new—very
different from that mossy dilapidated
one of the cottar’s house; and
above the porch flourishes a superb
“fouat.” The door, as usual, is
hospitably open, and you see that
within all are prepared for going
abroad; for there is a penny wedding
in the town, which already has roused
all Anster.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who is this, standing by the window,
cloaked and hooded, young, but
a matron, and with that beautiful
happy light upon her face? Under
her hood, young as she is, appears the
white edge of lace, which proves her
to have assumed already, over the
soft brown shining hair which crosses
her forehead, the close cap of the
wife; but nothing remains of the old
shy sad look, to tell you that this
is Isabell Stewart. Nor is it. Mrs
Stewart there, in her crimson plaid
and velvet hood, who is at present
delivering a lecture on household
economics, to which her daughter
listens with a happy smile, would be
the first to set you right if you spoke
that old name. Not Isabell Stewart—Leddy
Kilbrachmont!—a landed
woman, head of a plentiful household,
and the crown and honour of the
thrifty mother, whose training has
fitted her for such a lofty destiny,
whose counsels help her to fill it so
well.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet, equipped like the rest, goes
about the apartment, busily setting
everything “out of the road.” The
room is very much like the family
room in Kellie Mill: domestic architecture
of this homely class is not
capable of much variety; and hastily
Janet thrusts the same pretty wheel
into a corner, and her mother locks
the glistening doors of the oak
aumrie. Without stands Philip Landale,
speaking of his crops to the
miller; and a good-looking young
sailor, <em>fiancée</em> of the coquettish Janet,
lingers at the door, waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there is another person in the
background, draping the black lace
which adorns her new cloak gracefully
over her arm, throwing back her
shoulders with a slightly ostentatious,
disdainful movement, and holding up
her head like Lady Anne. Ah,
Katie! simple among the great
people, but very anxious to look like
a grand lady among the small! Very
willing are you in your heart to have
the unsophisticated fun of this penny
wedding to which you are bound,
but with a dignified reluctance are
you preparing to go; and though
Isabell smiles, and Janet pretends to
laugh, Janet’s betrothed is awed, and
thinks there is something very magnificent
about Lady Anne Erskine’s
friend. They make quite a procession
as they cross the burn, and wind along
the pathway towards the town;—Janet
and her companion hurrying on
first; young Kilbrachmont following,
very proud of the wife who holds his
arm, and looking with smiling admiration
on the little pretty sister at his
other hand; while the miller and his
wife bring up the rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weel, I wouldna be a boaster,”
said Mrs Stewart; “it would ill set
us, wi’ sae muckle reason as we have
to be thankful. But just look at that
bairn. It’s my fear she’ll be getting
a man o’ anither rank than ours, the
little cuttie! I wouldna say but she
looks down on Kilbrachmont his ain
very sel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s no blate to do onything o’
the kind,” said the miller.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And how’s the like o’ you to
ken?” retorted his wife. “It’s my
ain blame, nae doubt, for speaking to
ye. Ye’re a’ very weel with your
happer and your meal, John Stewart;
but what should you ken about young
womenfolk?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weel, weel, sae be it, Isabell,”
said John. “It’s a mercy ye think ye
understand yoursels, for to simple
folk ye’re faddomless, like the auld
enemy. I pretend to nae discernment
amang ye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There winna be ane like her in
the haill Town House,” said Mrs
Stewart to herself; “no Isabell even,
let alane Janet; and the bit pridefu’
look—the little cuttie!—as if <em>she</em> was
ony better than her neighbours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Town House of West Anster
is a low-roofed, small-windowed
room, looking out to the churchyard
on one side, and to a very quiet
street on the other; for West Anster
is a suburban and rural place, in comparison
with its more active brother
on the other side of the burn, by
whom it is correspondingly despised.
Climbing up a narrow staircase, the
party entered the room, in which at
present there was very little space for
locomotion, as two long tables,
flanked by a double row of forms,
and spread for a dinner, at which it
was evident the article guest would
be a most plentiful one, occupied
almost the whole of the apartment.
The company had just begun to
assemble; and Katie, now daintily
condescending to accept her brother-in-law’s
arm, returned with him to
the foot of the stair, there to await
the return of the marriage procession
from the manse, at which just now
the ceremony was being performed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The street is overshadowed by
great trees—which, leaning over the
churchyard wall on one side, and
surrounding the manse, which is only
a few yards further down, on the
other—darken the little street, and
let in the sunshine picturesquely, in
bars and streaks, through the thinning
yellow foliage. There is a sound of
approaching music; a brisk fiddle,
performing “Fy let us a’ to the
bridal,” in its most animated style;
and gradually the procession becomes
visible, ascending from the dark
gates of the manse. The bridegroom
is an Anster fisherman. They have
all the breath of salt water about
them, these blue-jacketed sturdy
fellows who form his retinue, with
their white wedding favours. And
creditable to the mother town are
those manly sons of hers, trained to
danger from the cradle. The bride
is the daughter of a Kilbrachmont
cottar—was a servant in Kilbrachmont’s
house; and it is the kindly
connection between the employer and
the employed which brings the whole
family of Landales and Stewarts to
the penny wedding. She is pretty
and young, this bride; and the sun
glances in her hair, as she droops
her uncovered head, and fixes her
shy eyes on the ground. A long
train of attendant maidens follow
her; and nothing but the natural
tresses, snooded with silken ribbons,
adorn the young heads over which
these bright lines of sunshine glisten
as the procession passes on.</p>

<p class='c008'>With her little cloak hanging back
upon her shoulders, and her small
head elevated, looking down, or
rather looking up, (for this humble
bride is undeniably taller than little
Katie Stewart,) and smiling a smile
which she intends to be patronising,
but which by no means succeeds in
being so, Katie stands back to let
the bride pass; and the bride does
pass, drooping her blushing face
lower and lower, as her master wishes
her joy, and shakes her bashful reluctant
hand. But the bridesmaid, a
simple fisherman’s daughter, struck
with admiration of the little magnificent
Katie, abruptly halts before her,
and whispers to the young fisherman
who escorts her, that Kilbrachmont
and the little belle must enter first.
Katie is pleased: the girl’s admiration
strikes her more than the gaping
glances of ever so many rustic
wooers; and with such a little bow
as Lady Anne might have given, and
a rapid flush mounting to her forehead,
in spite of all her pretended
self-possession, she stepped into the
procession, and entered the room
after the bride.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who is this so busy and popular
among the youthful company already
assembled? You can see him from
the door, though he is at the further
end of the room, overtopping all his
neighbours like a youthful Saul. And
handsomely the sailor’s jacket sits on
his active, well-formed figure; and he
stoops slightly, as though he had some
fear of this low dingy roof. He has
a fine face too, browned with warm
suns, and gales; for William Morison
has sailed in the Mediterranean, and
is to be mate, this next voyage, of the
gay Levant schooner, which now lies
loading in Leith harbour. Willie
Morison! Only the brother of Janet’s
betrothed, little Katie; so you are
prepared to be good to him, and to
patronise your future brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c008'>His attention was fully occupied
just now. But suddenly his popularity
fails in that corner, and gibes take
the place of approbation. What ails
him? What has happened to him?
But he does not answer; he only
changes his place, creeping gradually
nearer, nearer, looking—alas, for
human presumption!—at you, little
Katie Stewart—magnificent, dignified
you!</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a somewhat rude, plentiful
dinner; and there is a perfect crowd
of guests. William Wood, the Elie
joiner, in the dark corner yonder,
counts the heads with an inward
chuckle, and congratulates himself
that, when all these have paid their
half-crowns, he shall carry a heavy
pocketful home with him, in payment
of the homely furniture he has made;
and the young couple have the price
of their plenishing cleared at once.
But the scene is rather a confused
noisy scene, till the dinner is over.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now clear away these long encumbering
tables, and tune your doleful
fiddles quickly, ye musical men, that
the dancers may not wait. Katie
tries to think of the stately minuets
which she saw and danced in Edinburgh;
but it will not do: it is impossible
to resist the magic of those
inspiriting reels; and now Willie
Morison is bending his high head
down to her, and asking her to
dance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Surely—yes—she will dance with
him—kindly and condescendingly, as
with a connection. No fear palpitates
at little Katie’s heart—not a single
throb of that tremor with which she
saw Sir Alexander approach the
window-seat in Lady Colville’s drawing-room;
and shy and quiet looks
Willie Morison, as she draws on that
graceful lace glove of hers, and gives
him her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strangely his great fingers close
over it, and Katie, looking up with a
little wonder, catches just his retreating,
shrinking eye. It makes her
curious, and she begins to watch—begins
to notice how he looks at her
stealthily, and does not meet her eye
with frankness as other people do.
Katie draws herself up, and again
becomes haughty, but again it will
not do. Kindly looks meet her on all
sides, friendly admiration, approbation,
praise; and the mother watching
her proudly yonder, and those
lingering shy looks at her side. She
plays with her glove in the intervals
of the dance—draws it up on her
white arm, and pulls it down; but it
is impossible to fold the wings of her
heart and keep it still, and it begins
to flutter with vague terror, let her
do what she will to calm its beating
down.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The burn sings under the moon,
and you cannot see it; but yonder
where it bends round the dark corner
of this field, it glimmers like a silver
bow. Something of witchcraft and
magic is in the place and time. Above,
the sky overflooded with the moonbeams;
behind, the Firth quivering
and trembling under them in an
ecstasy of silent light; below, the
grass which presses upon the narrow
footpath so dark and colourless, with
here and there a visible gem of dew
shining among its blades like a fallen
star. Along that high-road, which
stretches its broad white line westward,
lads and lasses are trooping
home, and their voices strike clearly
into the charmed air, but do not blend
with it, as does that lingering music
which dies away in the distance far
on the other side of the town, and the
soft voice of this burn near at hand.
The homeward procession to the
Milton is different from the outward
bound. Yonder, steadily at their
sober everyday pace, go the miller
and his wife. You can see her crimson
plaid faintly, through the silvered air
which pales its colour; but you cannot
mistake the broad outline of John
Stewart, or the little active figure of
the mistress of the Milton. Young
Kilbrachmont and Isabell have gone
home by another road, and Janet and
her betrothed are “convoying” some
of their friends on the way to Pittenweem,
and will not turn back till they
pass that little eerie house at the
Kirk Latch, where people say the
Red Slippers delight to promenade;
so never look doubtingly over your
shoulder, anxious Willie Morison, in
fear lest the noisy couple yonder
overtake you, and spoil this silent
progress home. Now and then Mrs
Stewart, rapidly marching on before,
turns her head to see that you are in
sight; but nothing else—for gradually
these voices on the road soften
and pass away—comes on your ear
or eye unpleasantly to remind you
that there is a host of beings in the
world, besides yourself and this shy
reluctant companion whose hand
rests on your arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>For under the new laced mantle, of
which she was so proud this morning,
Katie Stewart’s heart is stirring like
a bird. She is a step in advance of
him, eager to quicken this slow pace;
but he lingers—constantly lingers,
and some spell is on her, that she
cannot bid him hasten. Willie Morison!—only
the mate of that pretty
Levant schooner which lies in Leith
harbour; and the little proud Katie
tries to be angry at the presumption
which ventures to approach her—her,
to whom Sir Alexander did respectful
homage—whom the Honourable Andrew
signalled out for admiration;
but Katie’s pride, only as it melts and
struggles, makes the magic greater.
He does not speak a great deal; but
when he does, she stumbles strangely
in her answers; and then Katie feels
the blood flush to her face, and again
her foot advances quickly on the
narrow path, and her hand makes a
feint to glide out of that restraining
arm. No, think it not, little Katie—once
you almost wooed your heart to
receive into it, among all the bright
dreams which have their natural
habitation there, the courtly youthful
knight, whose reverent devoirs
charmed you into the land of old
romance; but, stubborn and honest,
the little wayward heart refused.
Now let your thoughts, alarmed and
anxious, press round their citadel and
keep this invader out. Alas! the besieged
fortress trembles already, lest
its defenders should fail and falter;
and angry and petulant grow the
resisting thoughts, and they swear to
rash vows in the silence. Rash vows—vows
in which there lies a hot impatient
premonition, that they must
be broken very soon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under those reeds, low beneath
those little overhanging banks, tufted
with waving rushes, you scarcely
could guess this burn was there, but
for the tinkling of its unseen steps;
but they walk beside it like listeners
entranced by fairy music. The silence
does not oppress nor embarrass them
now, for that ringing voice fills it up,
and is like a third person—a magical
elfin third person, whose presence
disturbs not their solitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Katie!” cries the house-mother,
looking back to mark how far behind
those lingerers are; and Katie again
impatiently quickens her pace, and
draws her companion on. The burn
grows louder now, rushing past the
idle wheel of the mill, and Mrs
Stewart has crossed the little bridge,
and they hear, through the still air,
the hasty sound with which she turns
the great key in the door. Immediately
there are visible evidences
that the mistress of the house is
within it again, for a sudden glow
brightens the dark window, and
throws a cheerful flickering light from
the open door; but the moon gleams
in the dark burn, pursuing the foaming
water down that descent it hurries
over; and the wet stones, which
impede its course, glimmer dubiously
in the light which throws its splendour
over all. Linger, little Katie—slower
and slower grow the steps of
your companion; linger to make the
night beautiful—to feel in your heart
as you never felt before, how beautiful
it is.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only Willie Morison! And yet a
little curiosity prompts you to look
out and watch him from your window
in the roof as you lay your cloak
aside. He is lingering still by the
burn—leaving it with reluctant, slow
steps—looking back and back as if he
could not make up his mind to go
away; and hastily, with a blush which
the darkness gently covers, you withdraw
from the window, little Katie,
knowing that it is quite impossible he
could have seen you, yet trembling
lest he has.</p>

<p class='c008'>The miller has the great Bible on
the table, and bitter is the reproof
which meets the late-returning Janet,
as her mother stands at the open
door and calls to her across the burn.
It is somewhat late, and Janet yawns
as she seats herself in the background,
out of the vigilant mother’s eye,
which, seeing everything, gives no
sign of weariness; and Katie meditatively
leans her head upon her hand,
and places her little Bible in the
shadow of her arm, as the family devotion
begins. But again and again,
before it has ended, Katie feels the
guilty blood flush over her forehead;
for the sacred words have faded from
before her downcast eyes, and she has
seen only the retreating figure going
slowly away in the moonlight—a
blush of indignant shame and self-anger,
too, as well as guilt; for this
is no Sir Alexander—no hero—but
only Willie Morison.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Send that monkey hame, Isabell,”
said John Stewart. He had just
returned thanks and taken up his
bonnet, as he rose from their homely
breakfast-table next morning. “Send
that monkey hame, I say; I’ll no hae
my house filled wi’ lads again for ony
gilpie’s pleasure. Let Katie’s joes
gang up to Kellie if they maun make
fules o’ themsels. Janet’s ser’d, Gude
be thankit; let’s hae nae mair o’t
noo.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s my desire, John Stewart,
you would just mind your ain business,
and leave the house to me,” answered
his wife. “If there’s ae sight in the
world I like waur than anither, it’s
a man pitting his hand into a house-wifeskep.
I ne’er meddle with your
meal. Robbie and you may be
tooming it a’ down the burn, for
ought I ken; but leave the lassies to
me, John, my man. I hae a hand
that can grip them yet, and that’s
what ye ne’er were gifted with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The miller shrugged his shoulders,
threw on his bonnet, but without any
further remonstrance went away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And how lang are ye to stay,
Katie?” resumed Mrs Stewart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll gang up to Kilbrachmont, if
ye’re wearying on me, mother,” answered
the little belle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haud your peace, ye cuttie. Is
that a way to answer your mother,
and me slaving for your guid, nicht
and day? But hear ye, Katie Stewart,
I’ll no hae Willie Morison coming
courting here; ae scone’s enow o’ a
baking. Janet there is to be cried
with Alick—what he could see in
her, I canna tell—next Sabbath but
twa; and though the Morisons are
very decent folk, we’re sib enough
wi’ ae wedding. So ye’ll mind what
I say, if Willie Morison comes here
at e’en.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I dinna ken what you mean,
mother,” said Katie indignantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll warrant Katie thinks him no
guid enough,” said Janet, with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will ye mind your wark, ye
taupie? What’s your business with
Katie’s thoughts? And let me never
mair see you sit there with a red face,
Katie Stewart, and tell a lie under
my very e’en. I’ll no thole’t. Janet,
redd up that table. Merran, you’re
wanted out in the East Park; if
Robbie and you canna be done with
that pickle taties the day, ye’ll ne’er
make saut to your kail; and now I’m
gaun in to Anster mysel’—see ye pit
some birr in your fingers the time I’m
away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never you heed my mother,
Katie,” said Janet benevolently, as
Mrs Stewart’s crimson plaid began to
disappear over the field. “She says
aye a hantle mair than she means;
and Willie may come the nicht, for a’
that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Willie may come! And do you
think <em>I</em> care if he never crossed Anster
Brig again?” exclaimed Katie with
burning indignation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weel, I wouldna say. He’s a
bonnie lad,” said Janet, as she lifted
the shining plates into the lower
shelf of the oak aumrie. “And if you
dinna care, Katie, what gars ye have
such a red face?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the fire,” murmured Katie,
with sudden humiliation; for her
cheeks indeed were burning—alas! as
the brave Sir Alexander’s name could
never make them burn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weel, he’s to sail in three weeks,
and he’ll be a fule if he troubles his
head about a disdainfu’ thing that
wouldna stand up for him, puir chield.
The first night ever Alick came after
me, I wouldna have held my tongue
and heard onybody speak ill of him;
and yesterday’s no the first day—no
by mony a Sabbath in the kirk, and
mony a night at hame—that Willie
Morison has gien weary looks at
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He can keep his looks to himsel,”
said Katie angrily, as the wheel <em>birled</em>
under her impatient hand. “It was
only to please ye a’ that I let him
come hame with me last night; and
he’s no a bonnie lad, and I dinna care
for him, Janet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet, with the firelight reddening
that round, stout, ruddy arm, with
which she lifts from the crook the
suspended kettle, pauses in the act to
look into Katie’s face. The eyelashes
tremble on the flushed cheek—the
head is drooping—poor little Katie
could almost cry with vexation and
shame.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merran is away to the field—the
sisters are alone; but Janet only
ventures to laugh a little as she goes
with some bustle about her work, and
records Katie’s blush and Katie’s
anger for the encouragement of Willie
Morison. Janet, who is experienced
in such matters, thinks these are
good signs.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the forenoon glides away, while
Katie sits absorbed and silent, turning
the pretty wheel, and musing on all
these affronts which have been put
upon her. Not the first by many
days on which Willie Morison has
dared to think of her! And she remembers
Sir Alexander, and that
moonlight night on which she watched
him looking up at Lady Anne
Erskine’s window, but very faintly,
very indifferently, comes before her
the dim outline of the youthful knight;
whereas most clearly visible in his
blue jacket, and with the fair hair
blown back from his ruddy, manly
face, appears this intruder, this Willie
Morison.</p>

<p class='c008'>The days are growing short. Very
soon now the dim clouds of the night
droop over these afternoon hours in
which Mrs Stewart says, “Naebody
can ever settle to wark.” It is just
cold enough to make the people out
of doors brisk in their pace, and to
quicken the blood it exhilarates; and
the voices of the field-labourers calling
to each other as the women gather
up the potato baskets and hoes
which they have used in their work,
and the men loose their horses from
the plough, and lead them home, ring
into the air with a clear musical
cadence which they have not at any
other time. Over the dark Firth,
from which now and then you catch
a long glistening gleam, which alone
in the darkness tells you it is there,
now suddenly blazes forth that beacon
on the May. Not a sober light, shining
under glass cases with the reflectors
of science behind, but an immense
fire piled high up in that iron cage
which crowns the strong grey tower;
a fiery, livid, desperate light, reddening
the dark waters which welter and
plunge below, so that you can fancy
it rather the torch of a forlorn hope,
fiercely gleaming upon ships dismasted
and despairing men, than the
soft clear lamp of help and kindness
guiding the coming and going passenger
through a dangerous way.</p>

<p class='c008'>The night is dark, and this ruddy
window in the Milton is innocent of
a curtain. Skilfully the fire has been
built, brightly it burns, paling the
ineffectual lamp up there, in its cruise
on the high mantelpiece. The corners
of the room are dark, and Merran,
still moving about here and there,
like a wandering star, crosses the
orbit of this homely domestic sun,
and anon mysteriously disappears into
the gloom. Here, in an arm-chair, sits
the miller, his bonnet laid aside, and
in his hand a Caledonian Mercury,
not of the most recent date, which he
alternately elevates to the lamplight,
and depresses to catch the bright glow
of the fire; for the miller’s eyes are
not so young as they once were,
though he scorns spectacles still.</p>

<p class='c008'>Opposite him, in the best place for
the light, sits Mrs Stewart, diligently
mending a garment of stout linen,
her own spinning, which time has
begun slightly to affect. But her
employment does not entirely engross
her vigilant eyes, which glance perpetually
round with quick scrutiny,
accompanied by remark, reproof, or
bit of pithy advice—advice which no
one dares openly refuse to take.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet is knitting a grey “rig-and-fur”
stocking, a duplicate of these
ones which are basking before the
fire on John Stewart’s substantial
legs. Constantly Janet’s clue is
straying on the floor, or Janet’s wires
becoming entangled; and when her
mother’s eyes are otherwise directed,
the hoiden lets her hands fall into
her lap, and gives her whole attention
to the whispered explosive jokes
which Alick Morison is producing
behind her chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Over there, where the light falls
fully on her, though it does not do
her so much service as the others,
little Katie gravely sits at the wheel,
and spins with a downcast face. Her
dress is very carefully arranged—much
more so than it would have
been in Kellie—and the graceful
cambric ruffles droop over her gloved
arms, and she holds her head, stooping
a little forward indeed, but still
in a dignified attitude, with conscious
pride and involuntary grace. Richly
the flickering firelight brings out the
golden gloss of that curl upon her
cheek, and the cheek itself is a little
flushed; but Katie is determinedly
grave and dignified, and very rarely
is cheated into a momentary smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>For he is here, this Willie Morison!
lingering over her wheel and her, a
great shadow, speaking now and then
when he can get an opportunity; but
Katie looks blank and unconscious—will
not hear him—and holds her
head stiffly in one position rather
than catch a glimpse of him as he
sways his tall person behind her.
Other lingering figures, half in the
gloom, half in the light, encircle the
little company by the fireside, and
contribute to the talk, which, among
them, is kept up merrily—Mrs
Stewart herself leading and directing
it, and only the dignified Katie quite
declining to join in the gossip and
rural raillery, which, after all, is
quite as witty, and—save that it is a
little Fifish—scarcely in any respect
less delicate than the <em>badinage</em> of
more refined circles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s no often Anster gets a blink
of your daughter. Is Miss Katie to
stay lang?” asked a young farmer,
whom Katie’s dress and manner had
awed into humility, as she intended
they should.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Katie, ye’re no often so mim.
Whatfor can ye no answer yoursel?”
said Mrs Stewart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lady Anne is away to England
with Lady Betty—for Lord Colville’s
ship’s come in,” said Katie sedately.
“There’s nobody at the Castle but
Lady Erskine. Lady Anne is to be
back in three weeks. She says that
in her letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In her letter! Little Katie Stewart
then receives letters from Lady Anne
Erskine! The young farmer was put
down; visions of seeing her a countess
yet crossed his eyes and disenchanted
him. “She’ll make a bonnie lady;
there’s few of them like her; but
she’ll never do for a poor man’s
wife,” he muttered to himself as
he withdrew a step or two from
the vicinity of the unattainable sour
plums.</p>

<p class='c008'>But not so Willie Morison. “I’ll
be three weeks of sailing mysel,” said
the mate of the schooner, scarcely
above his breath; and no one heard
him but Katie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three weeks! The petulant thoughts
rushed round their fortress, and vowed
to defend it to the death. But in
their very heat, alas! was there not
something which betrayed a lurking
traitor in the citadel, ready to display
the craven white flag from its
highest tower?</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Before the following pages issue
from the press, the contest involved
in the Parliamentary Elections will
be over. It is useless to speculate,
therefore, on what will so soon be determined
by a result which, for the
time at least, will settle who is to
hold the reins of power. Recording
our confident hope that the Conservative
party will obtain such a
majority as may enable them to carry
on the Government on those principles
which can alone heal the
wounds and allay the feuds which the
policy of their predecessors have implanted
in this country, it is of more
importance at this time to inquire
into the great and lasting interests
of the nation, and the present circumstances
in our ever-changing situation
which most loudly call for attention,
and must ere long force themselves
upon the consideration of
whatever Government is placed by
the people at the head of affairs.
The observations we are to offer are
chiefly of a practical and remedial
kind; for the changes to which they
refer are such as are altogether beyond
the reach of dispute, and on
which all parties, however much
divided on other subjects, are agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of these subjects, in point
of importance, beyond all question,
both to the present interests and future
destinies of the Empire, is the vast
increase in the annual supply of gold
for the use of the globe, which the
late discoveries in California and
Australia have made. Here, fortunately,
there is no room for dispute;
and, in fact, there is no dispute about
the facts. It is conceded on all sides
that the annual supply of the precious
metals, before the new discoveries,
was somewhat below £10,000,000 a-year;
of which about £6,000,000 was
the annual waste by the wearing of
coin, or the absorption of the precious
metals in objects of luxury; and
that before the end of 1851 this annual
supply had risen to £30,000,000.
There has been very little addition to
the annual waste; so that the quantity
annually added to the sum total
of the precious metals in this world
has been multiplied at least <em>fivefold</em>
during the last three years. It has
risen from £4,000,000 annually to at
least £20,000,000. And the recent
accounts from Australia leave no
room for doubt that this increase in
the supply, how great soever, will be
largely added to; for it appears that
from 9th October to 9th April the
yield of the Australian gold mines
was above £3,000,000; and there
appears to be no limits to the extent
of the auriferous regions. It is quite
certain, therefore, that the annual
addition to the stock of the precious
metals in the globe, will this year,
and for a long period to come, be at
least <span class='fss'>SIX TIMES</span> what it was before
Providence revealed these hidden treasures
to a suffering world.</p>

<p class='c008'>The effect of this upon the price
of gold may be judged of by the fact,
that that metal is now selling at Melbourne
for £3 an ounce, while the
Mint price is £3, 17s. 10½d., which
the bank is still obliged to give for all
the gold brought to its doors! Sir
Robert Peel said that “he could not
by any effort of his understanding
form any other idea of a pound sterling
but a certain determinate <em>weight
of gold metal</em>;” and the <cite>Times</cite>, in the
pride of its heart at the vast effect of
his monetary system in depressing
the price of produce of every soil, and
enhancing the value of money, boasted,
within the last three years, that that
system “had <em>rendered the sovereign
worth two sovereigns</em>.” We have not
observed lately anything said in that
able journal about the incomparable
steadiness of a standard of value
founded on “a determinate weight of
gold;” nor do we hear any repetition,
by its gifted authors, of its boasts
about having rendered “the sovereign
worth two sovereigns.” On
the contrary, according to their usual
system, when they see a change fairly
set in, and likely to be lasting, they
have gone at once over to the other side,
and fairly out-Heroded Herod in their
estimate of the prodigious effect upon
general prices of the vast additions
recently made to the metallic treasures
of the world. The journal which was
so strong upon Sir Robert Peel’s policy
having rendered the sovereign worth
two sovereigns, has lately issued the
following just and striking observations
upon the probable effect on prices
of all sorts of the entire repeal of that
policy by the hand of nature:—</p>

<p class='c015'>“To arrive at an exact solution, it would
be necessary to ascertain the amount of
gold and silver in the world, and the
present annual consumption for coinage
and the arts. This is impossible, and conjectural
quantities must consequently be
taken. The total of coin has been guessed
at £400,000,000. Of this £150,000,000
may be assumed to be gold, and
£250,000,000 silver. The annual consumption
of gold is believed to be under
£6,000,000.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Starting with these figures, if the demand
for gold were likely to continue
limited to its ordinary amount, an estimate
of the effect of the supplies now
pouring upon us could easily be formed.
Those supplies within the few years since
the discovery of California have probably in
the aggregate left us an excess of upwards
of £30,000,000 over what has hitherto
been found sufficient for current wants, and
to maintain an equilibrium in the general
relations of property. The increase,
therefore, has been equal to 20 per cent
on the whole sum in existence; in other
words, the measure of value would
appear to have been extended one-fifth,
(just as if a 25-inch measure were extended
to 30 inches,) and hence the
effect to be looked for is obvious. Where
gold is the standard, the price of every
article adjusts itself to the relation it
bears to that metal. If sovereigns were
twice as numerous, a man would demand
two where he now takes one. An increase
of 20 per cent in the supply
should, therefore, have been followed by
a proportionate advance in the nominal
value of all things.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We have now, however, to consider
the future. So long as there is any
silver, to be supplanted in countries
where, owing to the existence of a double
standard, it is optional for the debtor to
pay either in gold or in silver, the effects
of the increased production will continue
to be extended to both metals, and consequently,
if the surplus of gold this
year should be, as has been estimated,
£25,000,000, its influence upon prices
could be but 6 or 7 per cent. But the
period must rapidly approach when the
displacement of silver will have ended,
and when the changes brought about
will be upon gold alone. In France the
existing amount of silver is still, doubtless,
very large; but this is not the case in the
United States, and the proposed law by
which the coins below a dollar are to be
deteriorated 6.91 per cent will prevent
for the present any action upon that portion
of the stock. In Germany the
debased state of the silver coinage will
likewise for a long time preserve it from
displacement. In Holland, silver has
been already established as the standard,
and cannot therefore be driven out.
With regard to Eastern nations, it is
difficult to form any estimate. On the
whole, however, we may infer the possibility
of the displacement process still
occupying three or four years, and that
during that time, therefore, the effects to
be produced will be spread, as they have
thus far been, over both metals.</p>

<p class='c016'>“At the end of that period, the consequences
will be felt by gold alone, and
the relations of property measured by a
gold standard will proportionably exhibit
a more rapid disturbance. At the same
time, it must not be overlooked that the
increase of gold each year will have
meanwhile diminished the per-centage of
alteration which would otherwise take
place. For instance, the total amount of
gold in the world, which is now assumed
at £150,000,000, would then possibly be
£250,000,000; and a production which,
operating upon the first sum, would
cause a rise in prices of 10 per cent,
would, under those circumstances, cause
only an additional rise of 6 per cent.
This is a feature of great importance in
the whole question, because it will constantly
tend to counteract that increasing
ratio of disturbance which might be
anticipated if the supply of each succeeding
year should prove larger and
larger. It is likewise to be borne in
mind that, with a diminution in the purchasing
power of gold, there will be a
proportionate diminution in the inducement
to seek it. If the quantity of gold
were doubled to-morrow, a man who is
at present content to work for one ounce
a-week would then not be satisfied with
less than two ounces.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In the face, however, of these qualifying
circumstances, and of the uncertainty
of all the assumed totals that have
been dealt with, it will be plain to most
persons that there is enough to <em>suggest
some very decided ideas as to the main
results that are coming on</em>. A mistake of
a hundred millions in the figures one
way or the other would only make a difference
of three or four years (where
the annual supply is at the rate of
£30,000,000) in the date of fulfilment.
Even if we were to take the whole
£400,000,000 of assumed money as liable
to be acted upon, <em>it would require little
more than fifteen years of the existing production
to cause an alteration in the relations
of property of 50 per cent.</em>”—<cite>Times</cite>,
June 20, 1852.</p>

<p class='c013'>These are abundantly curious
statements to come from the leading
journal in the monied interest, which
has so long supported Sir Robert
Peel’s monetary policy, which went
to make money dear and everything
else cheap, and boasted, with smiling
complacency, that he had succeeded
in making the sovereign worth two
sovereigns, and of course doubling the
weight of every tax and shilling of
debt, public and private, throughout
the realm. So great a change makes us
despair of nothing; and we even look
forward with some confidence to the
advent of a period when <em>The Times</em>,
as a “State necessity” which can no
longer be avoided, will be the first to
advocate a return to protection on
every species of industry within the
realm.</p>

<p class='c008'>We should greatly err if we measured
the effects of this vast addition
to the metallic treasures of the globe
merely by its effect in raising prices,
great and important as that effect undoubtedly
is. That it will raise prices,
gradually, indeed, but certainly, so that
in twenty years they will have reached
the level they had attained during
the extensive demand and plentiful
paper circulation of the war, may be
considered certain. No human power
can arrest the change any more than
it can the rays of summer or the rains
of autumn; and, therefore, all concerned—money-lenders,
money-borrowers,
capitalists, landlords, farmers,
and manufacturers—had just as well
make up their minds to it as <i><span lang="fr">un fait
accompli</span></i>, and regulate their measures
and calculations accordingly. But a
still more important effect, in reference
to our laws and social condition
in the mean time, is to be found in its
tendency to <em>keep the paper circulation
out</em>, and allay the apprehensions
of bankers and money-lenders as to
the risks of extending their issues,
from a dread of an approaching monetary
crisis, and a run upon their establishments
for a conversion of their
notes into gold.</p>

<p class='c008'>These monetary crises, which have
occurred so often, and been attended
with such devastation, during the last
thirty years, were all of artificial creation.
They were never known before
the fatal system was introduced of
considering paper not as a <em>substitute
for</em>, but as a <em>representative of gold</em>,
and of course entirely dependent for
its extension or contraction upon the
retention of, or a drain upon, the
reserves of the precious metals. It
is to the Bullion Committee of 1810,
and the adoption of its doctrines by
Sir Robert Peel by the Bill of 1819,
that we owe that fatal change which
not only deprived us of the chief advantages
of credit, but converted it
into the source of the most <em>unmeasured
evil</em>, by stimulating industry in the
most unbounded way at one time, and
as suddenly and violently contracting
it at another. The true use of a paper
circulation, properly based, judiciously
issued, and founded upon credit, is just
the reverse: it is to supply the circulation,
and keep it at the level which
the wants of the community require in
those periods of necessary periodical
recurrence to every mercantile state,
when the precious metals are drained
away in large quantities by the necessities
of war or the demands of a fluctuating
commerce; and when, unless its
place is supplied by the enlarged issue
of paper, nothing but ruin and misery
to all persons engaged in industrial
occupations can ensue. Supplied by
such a succedaneum, the most entire
departure of the precious metals is
attended, as was proved in 1810, by
no sort of distress, either to the nation
or the individuals of which it is
composed. Without such a reserve
to fall back upon—or, what is worse,
with the reserve itself rendered dependent
on the retention of the precious
metals—any considerable drain
upon them is the certain forerunner,
as was proved in 1825 and 1847, of
the most unbounded public and private
calamities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gold of California and Australia
has not entirely obviated these
dangers, but it has greatly diminished
the chance of their recurrence.
It is still true that a sudden drain of
gold for exportation, either for the
purposes of commerce or the necessities
of war, might, as in times past,
occasion such a demand for gold on
the Bank of England as would render
defensive measures on the part of the
Bank a matter of necessity. Till the
Bank is authorised by law on such an
emergence to issue an increased quantity
of notes <em>not convertible into gold</em>,
absolute security cannot be obtained
against such a catastrophe. But
when the supply of gold from California
and Australia is so great that
£1,250,000 is received from the latter,
as it has lately been, in <em>three
weeks</em>, and the bullion in the vaults
of the Bank of England amounts to
£22,220,000, <em>nearly a million more
than its whole notes in circulation</em>, it is
obvious that the chances of any such
calamity are very much diminished.
An ample supply has been provided
by Providence for the necessities in
currency, not merely of this country,
but of the entire earth, and therefore
the chances of any violent contraction
being rendered necessary by the sudden
and extensive exportation of the
precious metals have been greatly
diminished.</p>

<p class='c008'>The people of Great Britain may
await in patience the inevitable result
of the vast increase in the supply of
the precious metals upon the prices
of every article of commerce. That
effect is undoubtedly, at present, an
<em>arrest of the fall</em> which has so long
been felt as so distressing by producers
and holders of commodities;
and this will be followed by a gradual
but uninterrupted, and, at length,
very great rise of prices. Beyond
all doubt, the war prices will be
restored before ten years have
elapsed; and if the supplies of gold
shall go on as they have done for the
last two years, before twenty years
are over prices will be doubled. Interested
parties may complain as they
like of this change—the thing is inevitable,
and must be submitted to.
They might just as well complain of
the extension of the day in spring, or
its contraction in autumn; the certainty
of death, or the liability to
disease. It is of more importance to
form a clear idea of what the effects
of this rise of prices will really be,
both upon the producing and consuming
classes, and to show the
people how they should be on their
guard against the attempts which
will to a certainty be made to deprive
them of the benefits designed for
them by Providence.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the industrial classes, whether
in the produce of land, mines, or
manufactures, it need hardly be said
that this gradual rise of prices will be
the greatest of all possible blessings.
They may easily prognosticate what
these will be: experience has given
them a clear mode of estimating
them. They have only to figure to
themselves the <em>very reverse</em> of the
whole seasons of distress which they
have experienced during the last
thirty-five years, to foresee their
destiny. We shall not say that their
condition will resemble what it was
during the periods of excitement of
1824, 1836, or 1845; because these
were artificial periods, when the effects
of our monetary laws acted as ruinously
in fostering speculation, as they
did in the years immediately following
in contracting the currency
by which it was to be carried
on. The change, in this instance,
like all those induced by the wisdom
of Nature, not occasioned by
the folly or precipitation of man, will
be gradual in its operation. The
rise of prices will be so slow that
it will from year to year be scarcely
perceptible. From ten years, however,
to ten years, it will be very
conspicuous, and produce most important
effects upon the progress of
society. It will be gradual, but ceaseless,
and unaccompanied by any of
those vacillations which, under our
monetary laws for the last thirty
years, have produced such frightful
devastation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor need the consuming classes be
under any apprehension that this rise
of prices, which it is altogether beyond
their power to prevent, will in the end
prove detrimental to their interests.
But for the delusions which, for their
own purposes, the Free-Trade party
have diffused through the world, it
would have been superfluous, and in
truth ridiculous, to have said anything
on this subject. Every consumer
stands on some producer: <i><span lang="la">ex
nihilo nihil fit</span></i>. Is any argument required
to show that the former cannot
be in the long run injured by the
bettering of the condition of the latter,
by whose industry he is maintained?
It is as clear as any proposition in
geometry, that if the producing classes
are kept in a prosperous condition, there
must every year be an addition made
to the sum total of the produce, which
is divided among, and maintains the
<em>fainéants</em> consumers. Those who depend
upon fixed money-payments,
indeed—as fundholders, annuitants,
bondholders, and the like—will, in
the first instance, undoubtedly be
placed in a worse condition, because
the money they receive will not go so
far in the purchase of commodities as
it once did. But this evil will even
to them be in a degree compensated
by the superior steadiness in money
transactions, which a plentiful circulating
medium never fails to induce,
and the absence of those periodical
monetary crises, the result of faulty
legislation, which have so often in the
last thirty years swallowed up the
investments deemed the most secure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great and lasting relief to the
nation which this gradual but certain
rise in the money price of every
species of produce cannot fail to produce,
is the sensible diminution it
will occasion in the weight of debts
and taxes. If prices return, as in all
probability they will, to the war level,
there will be no greater difficulty in
raising an adequate revenue for the
State than there was during its continuance.
The excuse that we cannot
afford to defend ourselves, from our
having become so very poor amidst our
boasted Free Trade riches, will no
longer avail. The taxes of £50,000,000
a-year will be practically reduced to
£25,000,000; the debt of £800,000,000
to £400,000,000. The private
debts, mortgages, and bonds, of
£1,000,000,000, will be virtually reduced
to £500,000,000. These are
immense blessings, the consequence
of Nature having reversed Sir R.
Peel’s monetary policy, which, by
rendering the sovereign, as the <cite>Times</cite>
boasted, worth two sovereigns, had to
all practical purposes doubled those
burdens; and they are worth tenfold
more, even in a pecuniary point of
view, than all that the Liberal party
by their cry for economy have effected
for the country during the last
half-century.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the very magnitude of these
blessings which are in store for the
nation, if it is not cheated out of
them, renders it the more necessary
that the <em>utmost vigilance</em> should be
exerted, lest, by cunning on the one
side, and supineness on the other,
they are lost. Rely upon it, the
monied class who have seen their
realised capital doubled in value and
practical amount, during the last
thirty years, by Sir R. Peel’s artificial
scarcity of the currency, will do their
utmost to prevent the effects of the
extension of it by Nature. Possibly
they may endeavour to do this by
withdrawing a large part, if not the
whole, of the five-pound notes from
circulation. Possibly they may attempt
it by altering the standard,
as by increasing the weight and quantity
of gold in a pound. There is
little danger of their succeeding in the
first, because the inconvenience of
carrying about large sums in so heavy
an article as gold, will soon, as was
the case with the abolition of the
Sunday delivery of letters, compel
their re-issue. But there is much more
danger that they will succeed in the
last, and, by increasing the quantity
of gold in a pound sterling in proportion
to the fall in its value, succeed
in keeping prices at their present low
level, notwithstanding all the addition
which California and Australia
have made to the circulating medium
of the globe. Sir Robert Peel said
that he could not, by any effort of his
understanding, attach any other idea
to a pound sterling, but “a certain
determinate weight of gold bullion.”
But that was when gold was every
day becoming scarcer and more valuable,
and therefore the value of all
realised fortunes measured by that
pound was daily increasing. Now
that it is daily diminishing, we venture
to predict that his followers will
discover they can attach <em>some other
idea to a pound than a certain number
of pennyweights of gold</em>. Their ideas
will become expansive, and the pound
will swell out with them. Having
doubled their realised fortunes at the
expense of the industrious classes
when they had made money scarce,
they will strive to prevent their wealth
being restored to its original dimensions
when the precious metals are
becoming plentiful. If the standard
is changed in proportion to the fall in
the value of gold, <em>though it was religiously
upheld when it was dear and
scarce</em>, the result will be that the
weight of debt and taxes will remain
just what they were; prices measured
by gold will continue nearly at their
present level; and all the encouragement
to industry, and relief from
burdens, which must ensue from the
extension of the currency, if the
standard is maintained at its present
weight, will be lost to the nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is of the utmost moment also
that all classes should be made fully
aware that the evils of Free Trade to
the native industry of this country
will not be in any sensible degree
alleviated—nay, that they will in all
probability in the end be increased—by
the increase of the supplies of gold
for the use of the world. The reason
is, that it is a <em>catholic</em> or universal
blessing, extending over all countries,
and <em>affecting prices, consequently, in a
proportional degree in every quarter of
the globe</em>. It will, in consequence,
leave the relative disadvantage of the
old and rich state, in competing with
the young and poor one for the supply
of agricultural produce, just where it
was. If it raises the price of wheat
in the English market from 40s. a
quarter to 60s., which in ten years,
at the present rate of supply, will probably
be the case, it will as certainly
raise the price in Dantzic from 18s.
to 27s., leaving the English farmer
<em>still at the same disadvantage in competing
with his poorer neighbour that
he is at present</em>. Nay, the disadvantage
will rather be increased; for
gold, like every other valuable commodity,
will be attracted to the richest
country and the best market, and
from an unusually large portion of it
flowing into England, the effect in
elevating prices will be more sensibly
felt there than elsewhere. Prices will
rise more in proportion in the rich
than in the poorer states, where much
less of it can be purchased or find its
resting-place; so that the last state
of the industrious classes, so far as
competing with foreign nations is concerned,
will be worse than the first.
In so far, doubtless, as our agriculturists
are depressed by the weight of
taxes, they will experience relief from
the extension of the currency; but
they will derive none save in that
way from the change of prices in
competing with the foreigner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding this untoward circumstance,
there can be no doubt that
the condition of the agricultural classes
will be sensibly benefited by the rise
of prices, and that the depression
under which they have so long suffered
from the long-continued fall, will be
in a great measure arrested. Great
and important political benefits will
follow from this change. The undue
preponderance of the wealthy classes,
and the shopkeepers dependent on
them, owing to legislation having
doubled their fortunes at the expense
of the industrial, will be arrested.
As it was the scarcity of money,
preponderance given to capital, and
depression of industry consequent
on the monetary bill of 1819, which,
beyond all doubt, brought about the
Reform Bill, and with it the sway of
the shopkeeping interest in the boroughs,
which landed us in Free Trade
and all its consequences, agricultural,
maritime, and colonial; so a series of
effects the very converse of all these
may be anticipated from the expansion
of the currency which has flowed
from the bounty of Nature. We do
not say that, in consequence of these
changes, any man who now has a vote
either should or will lose it; but this
we do say, that many men and many
places, which have now no voice in the
Legislature, will be duly represented.
In particular, if the monopoly and preponderance
of home capital is broken
up, and the interests of industry are
duly represented in Parliament, it will
be impossible to withhold direct seats
in the Imperial Legislature from the
Colonies, if Free-Trade principles
have not previously severed them from
the British Empire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Connected with this subject of the
extension of our circulating medium
by the discoveries in California and
Australia, is another not less startling,
and fraught with not less important
consequences upon the future
destinies of the country. This is the
prodigious increase of <span class='sc'>Emigration</span>
which has taken place since Free-Trade
principles were carried into
practice by Sir Robert Peel in 1846.
To show the vast effects of that
policy, it is only necessary to reflect
on the subjoined Table, showing the
progress of emigration for six years
before and after Free Trade. By a
curious coincidence, while by far the
greatest part of the immense increase
is to be ascribed to the depression of
domestic industry by the contraction
of the currency and influx of foreign
commodities, a certain portion of the
great exodus in the last year is to be
ascribed to the newly discovered gold
regions of the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The emigration for the first four
months of 1852, from the twelve principal
harbours of Great Britain, was
103,316; nearly the same as in the
corresponding period of last year,
when it was 103,280. Since that, in
May and June, the emigration, especially
to the gold regions of Australia,
has greatly increased, and it is now
going on at the rate of about 5000 a-week.
In all probability the emigration
this year will reach 350,000, of
which at least 50,000 will be to our
distant settlements on the shores of
Australia.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is enough to make the most
inconsiderate pause, and to fill with
the most serious reflections every
thoughtful mind. From three hundred
to three hundred and fifty thousand
persons emigrating from a single
country in a single year, and this at
the close of a period of six years,
during which the average exodus has
exceeded two hundred and fifty thousand
a-year! Such a fact as this
would, at any former period of English
history, have excited the utmost alarm
in the nation; but so habituated have
the people become to disaster since
the Free-Trade policy began, and so
entirely have they got into the habit
of looking only to the moment, and
disregarding altogether all remote consequences,
that it excites no sort of
sensation. The annual increase of the
population prior to 1845 was usually
considered to be 1000 a-day, or
365,000 a-year; and this was for long
a subject of congratulation and boast.
The population returns of 1851, however,
showed that, down to the end of
1846, it was only 230,000 a-year.
But now, as 330,000 emigrants leave
the British shores every year, there is
<span class='fss'>AN ANNUAL DECREASE UPON THE
WHOLE OF 100,000 SOULS</span>; and that
not of infants, or worn-out old persons,
but chiefly young men and
women in the prime of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Free-Trade party, at a loss to
explain this prodigious emigration, at
a time when legislative principles
were adopted, which, according to
them, were diffusing universal prosperity,
laboured hard to refer it to
other causes. In the first instance,
they said it was owing to the Irish
famine; in the last, to Nature having
scattered gold broadcast over the distant
regions of the earth. Both excuses
are devoid of foundation. The
potato famine occurred in 1846; and
since that time the harvests have been
so good that, <em>twice over</em>, a public
thanksgiving has been returned for
that blessing. If Free Trade has
really enriched the people of Great
Britain, it should only have <em>enhanced</em>,
except for other competitors, the market
for Irish wheat, oats, and cattle, in
the British Islands. It is rather too
late in 1852, six years after the famine
of 1846, to be reverting to that calamity
as a cause of the present exodus;
the more especially as, in the interim,
between death and emigration, two
millions of souls have disappeared in
the Emerald Isle.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The pretext of the immense and
increasing emigration being owing to
the discovery of the Californian and
Australian diggings is equally futile
and unfounded. Five thousand a-week
are now going there, a large
proportion of whom may reasonably
be considered as having been set in
motion by the El Dorado visions connected
with those regions. But supposing
that sixty thousand emigrants
this year land in Australia, of whom
forty thousand have been attracted
by the diggings, there will still remain
three hundred thousand emigrants
who have left the British
shores, chiefly for the United States,
irrespective of the gold mania. What
is the cause of this long-continued
exodus of our people?—a state of
things not only unparalleled in the
previous annals of this country, but
unexampled in the whole previous
history of the world. There is but
one explanation can be given of it:
the <cite>Spectator</cite>, in an able article on
this subject, has very candidly stated
the cause—it is <em>want of employment</em>
which drives so many abroad. Go
where you will among the middle and
working-classes, and you will hear
this cause assigned as the real reason
why so many are going abroad; and
equally universal is the lamentation,
that the persons going away are the
very <em>élite</em> of our people—the young,
the energetic, the industrious; leaving
only children, and aged or decrepit
paupers to conduct the industry of
the country, and furnish recruits to
sustain its future fortunes.</p>

<p class='c008'>However lightly the Free-Traders
may treat the annual decrease of one
hundred thousand in our population,
and the commencement of a retrograde
movement in a nation which
has increased incessantly for four
hundred years, there is here deep
subject for lamentation to every lover
of his country, and sincerely interested
in its welfare. There can be no
question that an increase of the numbers
of the people, if accompanied by
no decline in their circumstances, is
the most decisive proof of public prosperity:
the Free-Traders themselves
acknowledge this, for they uniformly
refer with exultation to any increase,
however slight, in marriages, and
decline in paupers, which has occurred
while their system was in operation.
It is impossible to conceive that a
nation is thriving under a régime
which annually sends from three hundred
thousand to three hundred and
thirty thousand persons into exile.
You might as well say that an individual
is thriving under a dysentery,
which wastes him away at the rate of
two pounds a-day. The bonds of
country, home, habit, and companionship,
are never broken on a great
scale, and for a long time together,
by any other force but the force of
suffering. A golden El Dorado, a
passing famine, may for a single season
or two augment considerably the
number of emigrants; but these causes
are ephemeral in their operation, because
the first speedily leads to the
fortunate region being choked up with
entrants, the last to the wasted one
being bereft of inhabitants. But want
of employment, declining means of
obtaining a livelihood, is a chronic
disorder, which presses unceasingly
upon the people, and may drive them
into exile for every year of a century
together. It was this cause, induced
also by the free admission of foreign
grain, which first ruined the agriculture,
and at last put a period to the
existence, of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the increase of population in a
healthy and thriving state of society
leads to an additional increase, and
constantly adds to the breadth of the
basis on which the pyramid of the
national prosperity is rested, so a decline
in the numbers of the people is
attended by a precisely opposite effect.
In the first case, the prosperity of
every one class reacts upon the prosperity
of every other class; in the
last case, their suffering communicates
itself in an equally decisive way to
every class around them. As thus the
great trade of every nation is that
which goes on between the town and
the country, and each finds its chief
market in the wants of the other, it is
impossible that either can suffer
without the other class dependent on
the sale of its produce suffering also.
Extraneous causes, simultaneously
acting on the market, may for a time
prevent this effect becoming conspicuous;
but in the long run it is sure to
make itself felt. If the farmers are
suffering, the manufacturers will
speedily experience a falling off in the
home markets; if the manufacturers,
the farmers are as certain of finding a
diminution in the consumption of their
rude produce.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is now ascertained by Captain
Larcom’s report, that the wheat
grown in Ireland is less by 1,500,000
quarters than it was five years ago;
and by the reports of the English
markets for home grain, that a shortcoming
to a similar amount has taken
place in the home supplies of grain
for the county markets. 3,000,000
quarters less of wheat is raised in
England and Ireland than was done
before Free Trade began. Supposing
that an equal amount of other kinds
of grain has gone out of cultivation,
which is a most moderate supposition,
seeing that 10,000,000 quarters of
foreign grain are now annually imported,
when there were not 2,000,000
before, we have 6,000,000 less quarters
of grain annually raised in Great
Britain than was done before Free
Trade was introduced! The defalcation
has been nearly as great in the
supplies of cattle, sheep, and other
animals brought to the English market.
Beyond all doubt the value of
the produce that is raised has sunk a
fourth. The total agricultural produce
of the two islands has been estimated,
before Free Trade began, at
£250,000,000. At this rate, the loss
the cultivators have experienced from
this source alone is above £60,000,000
a-year. The Free-Traders boast that
it is £90,000,000; and considering
the diminution in the supplies of grain
and cattle raised at home, the estimate
is not much overcharged. At
all events, it is probably £75,000,000.
This is the real cause of the prodigious
emigration which is going on from
every part of the country; and as
this cause is permanent and ceaseless
in its operation, the decline of our
population may be expected to be as
continuous and progressive.</p>

<p class='c008'>This subject has been so well
handled by Sir F. Kelly in his late
admirable speech at Harwich, that
we cannot resist the temptation of
giving it publicity in a more durable
form than a daily journal.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now let us see what is the quantity
of wheat which is produced and sold in
this country. In 1844, it was 5,456,307
quarters; in 1845, 6,666,240 quarters;
and in 1846, 5,958,962 quarters. You
will therefore see that the fair average
of that production, taking the three
years, was about 6,000,000 quarters of
wheat produced by the farmers and
cultivators of the soil in England. Now,
let us see the years that succeeded 1849,
for the returns pass over the intermediate
years, before the repeal of the corn laws
had a fair trial, during which there was
only a gradual reduction of duty. In
1849 the Act of Parliament had complete
effect. The production of wheat in 1849
was 4,453,983 quarters; in 1850, 4,688,274
quarters; and in 1851, 4,487,041 quarters.
Now, taking the fair average, and
speaking in round numbers, that would
be a production in England of about
4,500,000 quarters of wheat per annum
since the repeal of the corn laws. Then
what is the difference?—that in the
three years before the repeal of the
corn laws the British farmers and cultivators
of the soil produced and made a
profit on 6,000,000 quarters of wheat,
while in the three years succeeding, that
important class of the people had fallen off
in their production to 4,500,000 quarters.
Here was a diminution of wheat in the
country of 1,500,000 qrs. per annum. I
shall not weary you by going into details
figure by figure as to the diminution
which has taken place in Scotland and
Ireland, but I pledge myself that on
these returns it will be found that the
diminution is still greater in Ireland,
though in Scotland it is somewhat less in
proportion. The result of the whole is,
that 4,500,000 quarters of wheat less
was produced in England, Scotland, and
Ireland during the three years after Free
Trade had a fair trial, than in the three
years before the passing of the act. I do
not wish to trouble you further with
these very painful details, but I will detain
you a single moment while I refer
to a return with regard to oats. In the
years 1845 and 1846, there were about
2,000,000 quarters of oats produced in
each year in this country. In the years
1850 and 1851, the production of oats in
the country was under 1,000,000 quarters;
so that while you find the falling off in
the production of wheat in the country
amounts to a quarter of the whole quantity,
the production of oats is reduced
from 2,000,000 to less than 1,000,000
quarters; and this, gentlemen, is the
system of Free Trade which some of my
friends among the electors say has been
so highly beneficial to the people of this
country.</p>

<p class='c013'>And in answer to the common
argument that, despite this rapid
decline of agricultural production, the
general well-being of the people has
increased, Sir Fitzroy observes—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now, it has been asserted that the
amount of poor-rates levied in the kingdom
has been less in the three years since
the repeal of the corn laws than in the
three years before 1846. But let us look
at the amount necessarily levied for the
poor in England and Wales during the
three years ending 1846, and the three
years beginning in 1848 and ending in
1850. In 1845, there was raised for the
relief of the poor £6,791,006. (“How much
did the poor get out of that?”) I hope
the whole of it. This I know, that we
paid it all. In 1846, the amount raised
was £6,800,623; in 1847, £6,964,825;
in 1848, £7,817,430; in 1849,£7,674,146;
in 1850, £7,270,493; and in 1851,
£6,778,914; making, therefore, in round
numbers, a million sterling more than was
levied for the relief of the poor before
the repeal of the corn laws. Now, it is
easy for manufacturers, for those well-paid
labourers who have not yet felt the
dire and terrible effects of this fatal
measure of legislation, to point to themselves,
and to laud and rejoice at the increased
prosperity of the country. I am
not taking Manchester, Liverpool, and
Stockport, any more than I do the counties
of Suffolk or Essex, but I am taking
the entire kingdom; and so far from the
system of Free Trade having increased the
general prosperity of the country, we
find that £1,000,000 a-year more has
been required for the support of the poor
since than before the repeal of the corn
laws, and before the entire system of Free
Trade had arrived at its completion. But
there is one more criterion by which to
judge of the effects of Free Trade. No one
will deny that the general prosperity of
the country, and the amount of deposits
in the savings banks, always proportionately
increase. It is always important to
see, whether what are called the lower,
but I would rather say the labouring
classes—a most important class, for on
their labours depends not merely the well-being
but the very existence of the rest
of the community—it is always important
to see whether, after any great legislative
changes, they are really so far benefited
as to be able to confer that great advantage
on their families of increasing their
deposits in the savings banks. Now,
in 1844, the amount of deposits was
£29,504,861; in 1845, £30,748,868;
and in 1846, £31,743,250. Here we arrive
at the dividing line, for in 1846
was passed the measure to which I am
now beseeching your cool and calm attention.
In the same year it began to
operate on that numerous class who contribute
deposits to the savings banks, and
let us see what was the result. In 1847,
the amount fell from £31,743,250 to
£30,207,180; in the next year it was
£28,114,136; in 1849, it was £28,537,010;
and in 1850, £27,198,563. This is the
last year to which the returns have been
corrected.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We have not observed any answer
attempted by the Liberal papers to
these convincing facts; they content
themselves with abusing the able
gentleman who brought them forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>These considerations reveal the real
causes both of the great exports and imports
of last year, and the vast losses
with which both were accompanied,
and the decline in the main articles
of our exports which is now going
on. It was the failure of the home
market, owing to Free Trade, which
did the whole. Finding the customary
channels of home consumption falling
off, our merchants were constrained,
at all hazards, to send their goods
abroad, and thence the great exportation,
amounting in all to £73,000,000
of goods, accompanied by no profit,
but by a loss of £19,000,000, as we
showed in a former article on the subject,
to the exporters.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Finding
credit easy, and money easily got
from the influence of California, they
engaged largely in importations, and
swelled our total imports, as Mr Newdegate
has proved, to £112,000,000.
But the result soon showed them that
it is impossible to import profitably
into an impoverished country; and
as most of these imports were sold at
from 15 to 20 per cent below prime
cost, implying a loss of not less than
£20,000,000 to the importers on our
imports, it is easy to say what species
of a commerce Free Trade has brought
upon the country. It is not surprising
in these circumstances that there
should now be a great decline in the
last quarter, in the exports of our
cotton goods, of nearly £500,000, and
that the revenue for the year ending
July 5, 1852, was above half a
million less than in the preceding
year.</p>

<p class='c008'>One thing is very remarkable with
reference to this prodigious stream of
emigration, that it is all <em>from the
land of Free Trade to the land of
Protection</em>. We are told that Free
Trade is the best, and Protection the
worst possible thing for the working-classes;
and yet above 300,000
of these very working-classes annually
leave the realm where that
charming thing Free Trade is in full
activity, and 500,000 persons from all
Europe, of whom 250,000 are from
the British isles, annually land in the
United States, <em>where the most stringent
system of Protection is established</em>!
Men do not sell off their
whole effects, pack up their little all,
and cross the Atlantic, to render their
condition worse. And has the 30 per
cent levied by the Americans upon
all foreign imports, without exception,
no hand in inducing and rendering
perpetual this immense stream
from the British islands to the Transatlantic
realms? If the iron-works of
America were exposed to the free
competition of the iron-masters of
South Wales and Lanarkshire, would
our iron-moulders and miners go in
crowds, as they are now doing, across
the Atlantic? If the cotton factories
of America were exposed to the competition
of those of Great Britain,
would our cotton-spinners and weavers
be straining, as they now are, every
nerve to reach the land of Protection?
Nay, if the cultivators of
America were not protected by the
enormous import duty on wheat and
oats, of which the Canadian farmers so
bitterly complain, would not discouragement
reach even the agriculturists
of that great and growing republic?
England, which is governed
by shopkeepers, may adopt in her
commercial policy the maxim that
to buy cheap and sell dear comprises
the whole of political wisdom: but
America, which is governed by the
working-classes, has discovered that
<em>high wages and good prices</em> are a much
better thing; and it is the practical
application of this maxim which is
the magnet that is attracting in such
multitudes the working-classes from
Europe—and, above all, from free-trading
England and Ireland—to the
protected Transatlantic shores.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is no wonder that the working-classes,
whether in agriculture or
manufactures, are hiving off in such
multitudes from the land of Free
Trade, and settling in that of Protection,
for the disasters which have
overtaken industry under the action
of Free Trade, in those quarters where
it has first been fully felt, have been
absolutely appalling. Look at the
West Indies. Lord Derby has told
us in the House of Peers—and every
post from those once flourishing and
now ruined realms bears witness to
the fact—that not only are the estates
in Jamaica nearly all going out of
cultivation, but the inhabitants themselves,
ruined by Free Trade, are
either leaving the island in quest of
employment, or relapsing into barbarism.
It is not surprising that this
terrible effect is taking place, for a
Parliamentary paper lately published
gives us the following astounding return
of the refined sugar imported into
Great Britain and Ireland in the year
1851:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is a result worked by Free
Trade, in less than four years after its
introduction into the colonies, sufficient
to make us hold our breath, and
far exceeding what the most gloomy
Protectionist ever predicted as the
result of Free Trade policy upon the
best interests of productive industry
in the empire. And the Free-Traders
think that they will be vindicated in
the eyes of God and man for their
frightful devastation, by the reflection
that, <em>while it is going on</em>, sugar has
fallen to 5d. a pound. We say advisedly,
“while it is going on;” for can
there be a doubt that, when the work
of destruction has been completed,
and, by having ruined our own colonies,
we are left entirely in the hands
of the foreign growers, prices will rise
again, not merely to their former, but
even a far higher level?</p>

<p class='c008'>Turn again to Ireland. We shall
say nothing of its 2,000,000 labourers
who have disappeared from the land
in the last five years, or its 1,500,000
quarters of wheat, being half the
amount of that cereal it produced,
which has gone out of cultivation during
the same time. We refer to the
report of a Parliamentary commission,
a favourite measure of Sir R. Peel’s and
the Free Trade party, which demonstrates
in the most decisive manner
the almost incredible amount of devastation
which Free Trade has
worked in a few years in the Emerald
Isle. It appears from the Report of
the Encumbered Estates Commissioners
that estates have been sold
by them charged with</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'>The figures are given from memory,
but they are in round numbers correct.
Now we do say, that here is a
decisive proof of a destruction of property
which would be unexampled
in history if the simultaneous ruin of
the West Indies may not be considered
as a parallel instance. Here is
property, which must have been worth,
when the debt was contracted, at
least £30,000,000 (for £2,000,000 is
a very small margin to leave for so
huge a mass of debt) sold for less
than £6,000,000, being <span class='fss'>A FIFTH PART
OF ITS FORMER VALUE</span>. The prices
which the land fetched, the commissioners
tell us, varied from <em>four
to fourteen years’ purchase</em>, the average
being ten years. We question
if the history of the world prior to
1846 will afford a parallel instance
of ruin of property by pacific legislative
measures. It is in vain to ascribe
this to the Irish famine: that was
over six years ago. Equally vain is
it to ascribe it to the savage and lawless
character of the Irish peasantry.
They were as lawless when creditors
advanced £28,000,000 on these estates
as they are now, and far more formidable,
because not weakened by
the loss of 2,000,000 of their numbers;
and if changed at all, it should
have been for the better, because they
have, for the last twenty-two years,
been under the government of the
Liberals and Free-Traders, such decided
friends in principle and practice
to the interests of labour, and the
welfare of the poor. The frightful
decline in value can be ascribed to
one cause, and only one—<em>Free Trade
in grain</em>—which has laid waste the
Emerald Isle as completely in many
places as <em>Free Trade in sugar</em> has
devastated the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c008'>One very curious result has flowed
from the effects of Free Trade, in producing
so prodigious a flood of emigration
from our shores, and of food
supplanting native industry to them,
that it has in a great degree concealed
the effect of the repeal of the Navigation
Laws upon our shipping. Man
and his food are, it is well known,
with the exception of wood for his
dwelling, the most bulky of all articles
of commerce. It so happens, by
a curious coincidence, that the three
articles, wood, corn, and human beings,
are precisely the ones which
Free Trade has caused to cross the
ocean in the greatest quantity. Our
emigration has risen, as already
shown, from an average of 90,000
souls to above 300,000. Above 2000
vessels are employed from Liverpool
alone in this annual exodus. The
importation of grain has quadrupled:
it has risen from an average of
2,500,000 quarters to one of 10,000,000
quarters. The importation of foreign
wood has advanced in nearly a
similar proportion. Thus changes
destructive to the nation’s industry
have for the time given a great
impetus to its shipping. What,
then, must have been the ruinous
effects of Free Trade in shipping on
our maritime interests, when, despite
this extraordinary and unforeseen
circumstance, arising from the profit
which great seaport towns sometimes
derive in the first instance from the
causes which are inducing national
ruin, so great a decline in our commercial
navy has ensued from Free
Trade in shipping, that it was publicly
stated on the hustings at Liverpool,
by one of the greatest merchants
in that city, without opposition,
that, in five years more, at the
present rate, <em>the foreign shipping
employed in conducting its gigantic
trade would be equal to the British</em>!</p>

<p class='c008'>The great and rapid decline in the
amount of grain raised in the British
islands since Free Trade was introduced,
is so serious a matter with reference
to our national independence,
that we gladly avail ourselves of the
following statistics, drawn from authentic
sources, driven by an able
contemporary, on the subject:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“We have taken the three years immediately
preceding the commercial changes
in 1846; because, up to that period, nothing
had occurred to induce our agriculturists
to raise less wheat than formerly.
On comparing their results with those of
the three last years, which were years of
complete Free Trade, we find a very
striking difference. In round numbers,
it may be stated that the average difference
between the two periods amounts
to no less than one million and a-half
of quarters. During the first period, in
other words, there were sold annually
six millions of quarters, and during the
last, four millions and a-half.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let us next turn to Ireland, where the
returns exhibit a much larger proportionate
decrease. We only possess authentic
accounts from the sister island
for four years; but, owing to the great
care and diligence bestowed by the Government
Commissioners upon the subject,
we believe they approach the truth
as nearly as the nature of such investigations
will admit. The following are
the quantities of wheat estimated to have
been produced in that country during
the under-stated years.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It will be seen from these returns that
the diminished production of wheat in
Ireland corresponds very nearly in
amount with the falling off exhibited by
the returns of the corn-law inspectors
in England. The aggregate amount of
decrease in the two countries is about
three million quarters.”—<cite>Morning Post,
June 24.</cite></p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it appears that the falling off in
<em>wheat alone</em>, raised in England and Ireland
in four years, has been, under the
action of Free Trade, about 3,000,000
quarters. The average consumption
of wheat in Great Britain, prior to the
late changes, was estimated by our
best authorities at 14,500,000 quarters,
being a quarter a head on
the people, excluding infants, and
persons, especially in Scotland, who
live on oatmeal or potatoes. Thus
more than a <span class='fss'>FIFTH PART OF THE
STAPLE FOOD OF OUR PEOPLE</span> has,
in four years of Free Trade, come to
be furnished from foreign states. If
the supplies of oats and Indian corn,
which are immense, and amount,
with wheat, to about 10,000,000
quarters annually, are taken into account,
it may safely be concluded
that <em>a fourth</em> of the food of our people
has come, in four short years, to be
imported! Liverpool has told us that,
in five years, half of this immense
supply will be brought in in foreign
bottoms! Truly we are advancing
at railway speed to a state of entire
dependence on foreign states for the
most necessary supplies; and we
shall soon realise in these realms
the lamentation of the Roman annalist,
that the people have come to
depend for their food on the winds
and the waves; or, in Claudian’s
words—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“Semper inops</div>
      <div class='line'>Ventique fidem poscebat et anni.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Three-fourths of these immense
supplies come from two countries
only—Russia and America. Can we
say that we are independent for a year
together, when either of these powers,
by simply closing their harbours, can
reduce us to scarcity—the two together
to famine prices? If a fourth
of our subsistence is cut off by an
ukase of the Autocrat of Russia, or a
mandate of the imperial people in the
United States, where will be the food
of the British people? Both these
powers were at war with us at the
same time in 1811;—are their dispositions
now so very friendly, and our
interests and theirs so little at variance,
that we can rely upon the
like thing not occurring again? And
if it does occur, could we hold out
three months against a second <em>Non-Importation</em>
Act, passed in either
country?</p>

<p class='c008'>We are often told of the great reduction
of taxation which has been
effected—to the amount, it is said,
of £12,000,000 sterling—since Free
Trade was introduced; but this statement
is grossly exaggerated. The
following tables, taken from a late
parliamentary paper, shows that the
reduction of taxation under Protection
has been nearly <span class='fss'>SEVEN TIMES
GREATER</span> than under Free Trade; for
in the former period the reduction
was £41,000,000, in the latter only
£6,500,000:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Further, how has this reduction of
£5,860,457 been effected? Simply by
the previous imposition of the income-tax,
which produced £5,629,000 before
Free Trade began. That is, Sir
R. Peel took taxes off the shoulders of
the whole community, when it was so
generally diffused that it was not felt,
and laid it as <em>an exclusive burden
upon less than 300,000 individuals</em> in
it! This is not reduction of taxation;
it is shifting the burden, for the sake
of popularity, from one class to another,
on whom it falls with crushing
severity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Free-Traders boast of a surplus
of above £2,500,000 annually
under the operation of their system.
But for the income-tax it would not
be a surplus at all, but a deficit of
£3,000,000 annually. So oppressive,
however, vexatious, and unjust is
that tax, and so enormous the severity
with which it presses upon agricultural
industry compared to commercial,
that its continuance cannot
much longer be endured. It has been
truly described as an “<em>impost</em> on the
landed interest, and a <em>contribution</em> by
the commercial.” And that really is
its character, so flagrant are the frauds
and evasions by which the unscrupulous
among the trading classes evade
its operation. The present high state
of the public funds, owing to the long
continuance of peace, the destruction
of a large part of the trading classes
by Sir Robert Peel’s monetary system,
and the impulse given to industry
by the repeal of that system, by
the opening of the great banks of issue
by Providence in California and Australia,
has now raised the 3 per cents
above 100, and gives a fair prospect
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer
being able to save £1,500,000 to the
nation annually, by converting the
3 per cents into a 2½ per cent stock.
Should he effect this, and, by the aid
of that reduction and the surplus,
succeed in taking off the income-tax,
he will confer the greatest boon ever
bestowed on his country since the
former tax of 10 per cent was repealed,
and do more to establish the popularity
of his administration, than
by any other measures that could
possibly be devised.</p>

<p class='c013'>By many who are fond of excitement,
and by some who require it, a
general election may be considered as
rather a pleasant event. It certainly
does break in upon the monotony of
everyday existence, and gives a
strong fillip to the latent energies of
the people. The burly energetic patriot,
who can spout, and bellow, and
declaim, now becomes a man of mark
and likelihood—a very Saul among
his brethren. The aged plotter of
the clique—“Sesina, that old negotiator”—as
he shuffles past, with a
dodge evidently concealed beneath
the grizzly penthouse of his eyebrows,
is regarded with mysterious awe as
the hierophant of electioneering wiles.
Even the veriest noodle finds his value
rising in the market; for, if he is fit
for nothing else, he can at least call
at the electors’ houses, and leave
cards for the candidates. Ever open
from morning to night are the doors
of the committee-rooms, vomiting
forth shoals of canvassers, and reabsorbing
them on their return with the
reports of their daily mission. All
this, we allow, may be agreeable to
those whose blood, in ordinary times,
is wont to stagnate; but, for our part,
we do not scruple to confess that such
an occasion as the present is exceedingly
distracting and inconvenient.
Our political principles, we take it,
are tolerably well known; nor is it
likely that, at the eleventh hour, we
should change the tenor of our opinions:
yet, in the course of the last
two days, we have been waited on by
no less than six separate sets of canvassers,
“respectfully soliciting,” as
they phrase it, our interest and vote
in favour of Radicals of every dye,
rank Whigs, and rampant Sectarians.
In the streets no man is safe. Second
votes are esteemed of more value
than the first; and every third man
you meet is intent upon nailing you
for a pledge. Under these circumstances,
availing ourselves of the plea
that the weather is too sultry to admit
of our stirring abroad, we have
deserted our study, and emigrated to
the attics, from the windows of which
we can command a wide view of the
distant Highland hills. Safe, therefore,
we trust we may consider ourselves,
for an hour or so at least, from
all interruption, save the twittering
of the swallows bringing food to their
young in the nest at the upper corner
of the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beautiful in their disarray, and recalling
many memories of forest, lake,
and hill, are the implements of sylvan
sport that our silent attic contains.
There, in one corner, are our rods,
six in number, from Behemoth, with
which we slew the giant salmon of
the Ness, to Spirling, the liveliest
little wand that ever struck midge
into the tongue of a Yarrow trout.
What would we not give at this moment
for a day’s fishing! O for a fairy
car to waft us away bodily from the
din of cities and hustings to the lovely
bosom of Loch Awe! Soft and green
wave the beeches in the summer
breeze on those islands where the
wood-hyacinth is so blue, and the
honeysuckle so flush and fragrant;
from the dark woods of Innistrynich
you hear the doling of the cushat;
while, nearer at hand, the mavis
breaks out into a burst of melody.
But there is a breeze on the loch, and
the boat is on the shore, and Dugald
opines that it is time to be up and
doing. At the first cast, up rises a
whopper, visibly yellow about the fin,
and weighing, we shall suppose, by
the way the line runs out, at least a
pound and three quarters. Never did
Limerick steel encounter a worthier
foeman. At length, in the experienced
hands of Dugald, the landing-net
does its duty; and there he lies
at the bottom of the boat, in all the
lustre of his stars. Are the trout not
rising to-day? With two pounders
simultaneously upon your line, you
may confidently answer—Yes; indeed,
there would seem to be no end
at all to their leaping. Towards
evening we shall go down the loch,
and try for a <em>salmo ferox</em> in Castle
Connal bay; in the mean time, let us
keep to the islands. But who is that
in the boat contending, if we mistake
not, with a salmon? Ha, Dugald! is
it so indeed?—the author of the <em>Moor
and the Loch</em>!</p>

<p class='c008'>Hark! there goes the bell, recalling
us at once from our day-dream. Who
the mischief can have come to trouble
us just now? What is this? Fire and
faggots! “Your vote and interest
are respectfully solicited in favour of
Mr Macwheedle.” Why, the man is
a rank Radical, and moreover coquetting
with the Papists! John, fling
this card into the waste-basket, and
tell the gentlemen who brought it,
with our compliments, that we are
particularly engaged at present, but
shall not fail to give our earnest attention
to the subject. And stay, as
the day is hot, you may as well offer
them a glass of beer. No one shall
say that we were guilty of discourtesy,
though we were very nearly on the
point of desiring them to go to Jericho.
For have they not cost us a long
journey, in bringing us back from
Loch Awe before our time?</p>

<p class='c008'>Vain would it be for us to retrace
our steps, and conjure up again the
eidolon of Mr Colquhoun in desperate
battle with the fish. More happy
than ourselves, he is doubtless at
breezy Sonachan, whilst we are in the
city, panting for a mouthful of refreshing
air. But though we cannot
remember him in person, we have his
book beside us; and a better, more
useful, or more entertaining companion
for a sportsman cannot anywhere
be found. Sporting treatises
ought, generally speaking, to be received
with considerable caution. Let
any man, who is either an angler or a
shot, reflect seriously on the enormous
amount of exaggeration in which he
has indulged whilst detailing the particulars
of his prowess, and he will, if
he has in him any candour at all,
understand the force of our observation.
Almost every one of us—and we
are no exception—are in the habit of
viewing our own exploits through
the medium of powerful magnifying
glasses. In doing so, we merely obey
a law of nature which exhorts men to
maintain their dignity and reputation;
and there is no point whatever upon
which people are so touchy as their
success in sporting. To doubt, far
less contradict, a gentleman who proffers
for your acceptance the narrative
of an enormous basketful killed a fortnight
ago in the Tweed; or that of a
red-deer, stopped at full speed in the
Athole forest, at a distance of four
hundred yards, by the rifle of the historian,
and so huge that Crerar absolutely
swooned at the sight of it; or of
myriads of grouse, brought down right
and left, without a single failure, is a
hideous breach of manners. If, in
your heart, you believe that your informant
is a much inferior sportsman
to yourself, you must meet him by
overpowering statements; and it is
very singular that, after having twice
told a fabulous Iliad of your exploits,
you end by thoroughly believing it.
The boundary line between the realm
of fact and that of fiction is very indistinct;
we ought rather to say that
it is nowhere absolutely marked, and
that there exists a large tract of debatable
land which may be plausibly
claimed for either. For example, we
are not at this moment certain whether
we ever shot a hooper or not. We
have, indeed, in our mind, a dream or
vision of a star lit loch, with six beautiful
white creatures feeding in a bay.
We remember how we crept along,
behind a dyke, our heart throbbing so
hard as almost to choke us; and we
can recall the agonising moment when
a stick broke beneath the pressure of
our knee, before we came within gunshot,
and when the sentinel bird
looked up as if conscious of the approach
of an intruder. We remember
how we levelled and fired. We remember
also the dash in the water,
and the whirr of wings; and if we do
not remember having brought down a
second swan, as it wheeled in circle,
it is simply because we are somewhat
dubious as to the real existence of the
first. We should cut but a poor figure
if we were questioned on oath as to
that transaction. Sometimes the vision
comes so clear that we have no
doubt whatever that we killed both
the swans. One lay dead-still in the
bay, its wings distended, and its long
neck sunk below the surface. The
other fluttered a little way out, but
we recovered him by means of a retriever.
Then the question rises—which
retriever was it, for we have
had four of them in our day? Was
it Neptune, unparalleled among the
reeds at the divine season of the flappers?
Or was it Grog, who was
never known to lose a wounded hare?
Or was it Cato, the curly, who could
do everything but speak? Or was it
Captain, who is at this moment the
inheritor of our best affections? We
cannot tell. It is impossible for us to
say when or where it occurred. Sometimes
we think it was in the Highlands,
and then we fix upon Loch
Sloy. At other times, it seems to us
that we slew the swans in Saint
Mary’s Loch, just below the Coppercleugh.
Occasionally we are inclined
to think that we only shot one of
them; and, when very much out of
spirits, we have seriously asked ourselves,
whether we ever saw a wild
swan, except stuffed, in a museum.
Being in this state of perplexity, our
practice is to split the difference of
belief, and to maintain, on ordinary
occasions, that we have shot one
hooper. Of course, after a few tumblers
with a sporting friend, we have
no hesitation in bringing forward the
second bird; but never, in any instance,
have we violated our convictions
by increasing the number to
three. With this example in our
mind, we always deal leniently with
sportsmen. If a gentleman is so enthusiastic
as to go out to Caffraria,
Upper Egypt, or the Cordilleras,
solely for the purpose of killing rhinoceroses,
crocodiles, or condors, why
should we doubt the truth of any narrative
which he may be pleased to
compile? How do you know that he
did <em>not</em> shoot fifteen lions in the course
of a summer’s evening, or that he did
<em>not</em> ride across the Nile on the back
of an enormous crocodile. To question
his veracity is simply to commit
that impertinence which we have seen
practised by snobs, who, not content
with your statement of the day’s sport,
make a point of peering into your
pannier, or examining the contents of
your game-bag. Such hounds were intended
by nature never to rise above
the rank of a water-bailiff. They
ought to be summarily dealt with,
and dismissed to their kennel, with
the reverse of a benison on their
heads, and perhaps with a hint to their
rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Colquhoun has this virtue, that
he keeps his imagination more entirely
in check, as regards matters of fact,
than any sportsman with whose writings
we are acquainted. He does not
make up his bag or fill his creel in a
random way; nor does he add to the
narrative of one day, quite enough
distinguished by its own achievements,
the events of another, which
perhaps took place a year before. Neither
does he commit the error, so common,
of representing every day as a
triumph. Read the accounts of most
modern anglers, and you are led to
conclude that they never, in the whole
course of their lives, have failed in
filling their baskets; whereas every
adept with the rod is well aware that
the days of disappointment greatly outnumber
those of success. The men
of the fowling-piece or rifle never miss.
If they are in the Highlands, there is
always a plethora of grouse and red-deer;
if in Central Africa, you would
suppose they were practising in a
menagerie, and you conclude that there
must be prime pluffing in Polito’s.
This, of course, is nonsense; and in
our humble opinion, it is calculated to
act disadvantageously on the character
of young sportsmen. Sporting,
in all its branches, is an art which requires
to be thoroughly studied on principle;
and it is very wrong to excite in
the youthful mind expectations which
cannot be fulfilled. A boy of fourteen
should not be told that he is adequate
to the capture of a salmon; or that
he has only to go to a certain river
and throw in his line, in order to secure
one. All education is progressive.
He should be entered with minnows,
and so made acquainted with the
science of bait-fishing; he should be
furthered with beardies, encouraged
with eels, and in due time initiated
into the mystery of capturing a trout
with the fly. After that, all is plain
sailing. But he should be made to
feel practically the difficulties which
attend even the rudiments of sport—not
be impressed with the idea that
there exist no difficulties whatever. We
have known many a fine young fellow,
who might have become a capital
sportsman, stopped at the commencement
of his career by the disgust engendered
by failure. The imagination
of the lad has been so excited by flowery
narratives that he cannot summon
up patience enough to bide his
appointed time: he must either succeed
at once, or he abandons the pursuit
for ever. We regret to observe
that the habits of athletic sport, once
so common to the youth of Scotland,
are rather on the decline; and our regret
arises from the conviction that
the fine bodily training which is given
by field sports contributes very much
to the development of a strong and
manly mind. It is not difficult to say,
after the perusal of any book, whether
the writer is or is not a sportsman.
If the former, there is a raciness in
his style, a familiarity with nature, and
a power of illustration, which immediately
rivet your attention. Had
Scott not been a sportsman, we should
have lost one great charm of his novels.
He of the back slums, on the contrary,
who never wandered by the water-side,
or took the hill with the gun
upon his shoulder, is always a feeble
writer. There is something sickly
about his sentiment; he is vapid, dull,
and queasy. His ideas of vegetation
are drawn from a window-box with
some stunted specimens of mignonette,
striving, in spite of soot, to struggle
into blossom,—or, at best, from a suburban
horse-chestnut. He derives his
images of animated life from a rabbit-hutch,
or an occasional visit to a
slaughter-house. He has no taste for
the roaring of the seas, the rushing of
the blast, or the thunders of a swollen
cataract. He seeks repose, maunders
about tranquillity, and presents you
with the sketch of a lake; which, on
examination, you discover to be the
accurate portraiture of a horse-pond.
Surely the development of ideas is as
important a point as the mere acquirement
of information. The one is to
be gathered in the field, the other in
the schools; and we are not sure that,
if we were assured that all the boys
were trained timeously to fishing, we
should not be inclined to vote for a
general prolongation of the holidays.</p>

<p class='c008'>We must really crave pardon of Mr
Colquhoun for having left him in this
unceremonious manner. Another
batch of canvassers, on the Seceding
interest, having probably received
notice of our imprudent act of hospitality,
has just invaded the premises,
and we have had great trouble in
getting rid of them at a considerable
expenditure of liquor. One gentleman
in a fustian jacket tried to engage
us in a discussion on the subject of
education; but, as his grammar was
singularly imperfect, we could not
accurately comprehend his meaning.
We parted, however, good friends,
notwithstanding that one acute Diomede
tried to make a Glaucus of us
in the matter of a bran-new hat
which happened to be exposed in the
lobby. Nathless we managed to retain
our basnet, and the ‘prentice-cup
went its way. We have said already
that Mr Colquhoun’s book may be
relied on for accuracy of fact; but we
should by no means wish to impress
our readers with the idea that he is
at all deficient in imagination, where
imagination can be legitimately employed.
Some of his descriptions
indeed are very beautiful, and recall
the picturesque scenery of the Highlands
to the mind as vividly as the inspired
pencil of Horatio Macculloch can
present it to the eye. But he never
condescends to make pictures merely
for effect; and perhaps it is this absence
of exaggeration which gives such a
stamp of truthfulness to his volume.
Neither does he affect the magnificent
in sporting—a fault which is rather
conspicuous in some other writers
whom we could name. After reading
the lucubrations of some sportsmen,
and hearing them discourse, you would
conclude that they never condescended
to expend powder and lead upon a
lesser object than a red-deer, and that
they would consider it highly derogatory
to exert their energies on the
capture of trout, in the unavoidable
absence of salmon. That is all fudge.
Deer-stalking is an excellent thing in
its way, and may indeed be considered
as the highest branch of the art venatorial
as practised in these islands;
but there is not one sportsman out of
five hundred who ever had the opportunity
of levelling his rifle at a stag,
and not one out of a thousand who
can pursue the sport systematically.
Besides this, the habitual deer-stalker
must be a person endowed with
uncommon stamina. Quickness of
vision—accuracy of aim—caution and
perseverance—are admirable things;
but the stalker of the deer in his
native solitudes must moreover possess
the inestimable gifts of muscle
and wind in larger proportion than is
usually allowed to the inhabitants of
cities. He must account it nothing
to lie half immersed for hours in a bog
or burn, without even the trifling excitement
of an occasional glimpse of
an antler; he must be prepared to
crawl up or rush down precipices, as
the exigency of the case or the movements
of the deer may require; and
he must, moreover, make up his mind
to return homewards many an evening,
after having been on the hills before
cock-crow, wet, weary, and famishing,
without a single incident to
console him for all his great exertion.
Now, there are very few people who
will willingly submit to this; and we
cannot wonder at it, if other sport can
be obtained with a less expenditure
of labour. We never knew a deer-stalker
yet who had lost his rest for
grouse-shooting; and we have known
several who, from choice, would
rather stalk a curlew than a stag.
Your “whaup,” indeed, is a most
difficult fellow to circumvent. Seated
on the sea-beach, he might defy the
approach of Sir Tristrem; indeed, to
have shot a whaup in the month of
October is an exploit of which any
man has just reason to be proud. The
true sportsman piques himself on the
universality of his skill, not in exclusive
addiction to one particular pursuit.
Therefore, as a general rule,
you may set down every writer on
sporting subjects who affects to be
more magnificent in his views than
his neighbours, either as an impostor,
who in reality knows little, or as a
monomaniac, whose general experiences
of the chase are worthless, and
who cannot serve as an adequate
guide.</p>

<p class='c008'>No branch of sporting comes amiss
to Mr Colquhoun, who is also an accomplished
naturalist. Great on the
lake and salmon-river, he is knowing
at the “lochan” and the burn; and
is aware that oftentimes as much
dexterity is required for the capture
of a half-pounder, as might suffice for
the hooking of the lordliest fish that
ever threaded the rapids of the Dee.
Even the piscatory student who knows
Stoddart by heart—and Tom has long
been considered as quite at the summit
of his craft—may obtain many a
valuable wrinkle from Colquhoun,
who is fertile in devices little known
to the majority of practical anglers.
It is the fashion of some of the brethren
of the wand to speak superciliously
of sea fishing, as if no sport
could be obtained except in fresh
water. Now we admit at once that
finer fishing is required in fresh than
in salt water; but there are times
when the latter may be resorted to
both with profit and amusement.
What the <em>haaf</em> or deep-sea fishing
may be we know not; but in the
lochs which indent the western shores
of Scotland excellent sport may be
obtained. We take leave to draw
the attention of our sporting friends,
who about this time of the year repair
to the Highlands, to the following
extract from the volume before us:—</p>

<p class='c015'>“The sea loch has a character peculiarly
its own—no wooded islands, no
green or pebbly margin, like its inland
sister, except, perhaps, for a short time at
full tide; and the dark mountain more
often rises abruptly from its side in
craggy and bold relief. It is a novel
sight for the traveller, whom the refreshing
evening breeze has tempted out of
the neighbouring inn, at the landlord’s
recommendation, to try his fishing luck
with such a clumsy rod and tackle as he
had never dreamt of before. The awkward-looking
herring ‘skows,’ well
matched with their black or red sails,
scudding in all directions; the nasal
twang of the Gaelic, as they pass the
bow or stern of his boat, shooting their
nets; the hardy weather-beaten face of
the Highlander, always civil in his reply,
and courteous in pointing out the most
likely ground to the ‘stranger’—reiterating
his injunctions (when his stock of
English extends no further) ‘to keep on
the <em>broo</em>,’ yet plainly showing that he
expects the like courtesy in return, and
that the least slip on your part would
immediately make him change his tone,—all
this can hardly fail to impress on
the mind of the imaginative, that the
spirit of the Highlands, though dormant,
is not dead, and to carry back his fancy
to the old times of clans, caterans, and
claymores.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The fishing of the sea loch is not
nearly so scientific as that of the inland.
The great art lies in being thoroughly
acquainted with the best state of the tide
for commencing operations—in having a
perfect knowledge of the fishing-ground,
and being able to set your long-line with
neatness and despatch. Having lived
for a couple of years on the banks of two
sea-lochs, I had every opportunity (which
I did not neglect) of practising the different
kinds of fishing, and making myself
master of the most propitious times of
the tide for doing so with success.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Trolling for sea-trout may be ranked
at the head of this fishing; but before
attempting to describe it, I shall mention
two curious facts relative to the sea-trout
and salmon, which it is difficult to account
for. One is, that the former will take
greedily in one loch, while you may troll
a whole day in its next neighbour, though
full of them, without getting a single bite.
This was precisely the case in the two
lochs alluded to. The other, that although
you may see the huge tails and back-fins
of salmon rising all round, I never heard
of one taking the bait; and during the
whole of my trolling in the salt water, I
have only killed one grilse. This is the
more strange, as the salmon is not at all
shy of the spinning-bait in the fresh-water
loch.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The best time to begin fishing for sea-trout
is at the turn of the tide when it
begins to ebb: the same rod and tackle
as when trolling from a boat in fresh
water. The herring-fry, salted, are the
most killing bait, (also excellent for large
fish in fresh-water lochs,) although minnows
are very good; a sand-eel may also
do, the black skin pulled over the head
so as to show nothing but the white body:
this shines very bright, but, as it does not
spin, is far less deadly than the others.
A boatman who thoroughly knows the
fishing-ground is indispensable, as it is
much more difficult to find out than in
the fresh water. Strong eddies formed
by the tide are often good places; also
any bays, especially if mountain-burns
run into them. The largest size of sea-trout
are caught in this way; and, when
hooked, from the depth and <em>strength</em> of
the water, make capital play. Large
lythe also are frequently taken; these
are like passionate boxers—fight furiously
for a short time, after which they are
quite helpless.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If there is a good pool at the mouth
of any mountain-burn, by going down
with your fly-rod during a ‘spate,’ or
coming down of the water after heavy
rain, <em>and when the tide is at the full</em>, you
may have excellent sport. The trout are
all floundering about, ready to take your
fly the moment it touches the water.
This only lasts for a short time, as they
all leave the pool at the receding of the
tide. I say nothing of sea-trout or salmon
flies, which vary so much in the different
lochs, rivers, and streams, that every
angler should be able to dress them for
himself. Any fishing-tackle maker will
be happy to teach him <em>for a consideration</em>.
He has then only to learn from an approved
hand near, what flies are best for
the loch or stream he intends to fish, and
tie them accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These latter remarks savour too
much of the old school. It may be
useful in the case of emergency to be
able to busk a fly; but we are free to
confess that it is upwards of twenty
years since we attempted such an
operation. In the days of our youth
we were accounted rather a good hand
at dressing, and could turn out, on
occasion, an excellent fac-simile of a
bumbee. But we discovered anon,
that to busk our own flies was a
frightful loss of time, and necessitated
the collection of an infinite quantity
of feather, fud, floss, carpet, and
twistings, which very soon, without
any manipulation on our part, produced
abundance of insect life in the
shape of moths. Therefore, one fine
morning we pitched the whole contents
of our poke out of the window,
and have since had recourse for our
supplies to the regular professional
artists. Every man who knows anything
at all about fishing is competent
to the selection of his own
flies; and notwithstanding all that
has been written to the contrary, we
assert, from our own experience, that
it is not necessary to carry with you
a very diversified stock. For trouting,
eight or ten of the most approved
sorts of flies are amply sufficient: of
course you must take care to have
them of different sizes. There is
more variety in salmon flies; but if
you attend properly to colour, you
may easily, at a moderate expense,
furnish such a pocket-book as will
enable you to fish with success in
every river in the kingdom, provided
you know how to handle your rod.
We by no means undervalue local
information. If you can pick up an
intelligent poacher, or in default of
him a gamekeeper, you can readily,
for the matter of a mutchkin, ascertain
what colour is considered most
killing on the particular river which
he depopulates; and you will find
something in your book which will
correspond accurately enough. If
you are short of flies, the same free-tacksman
of the stream will, for a
shilling or two, tie you as many as
you may require. And do not be
afraid that he will lack the material.
The feathers of the bubbly-jock make
admirable wings—a red cock, adorned
with a ruff of hackles, sounds his
trumpet upon every midden; and
your unlicensed acquaintance usually
contrives to put by various sylvan
furs and plumage, during the season
when game fetches a good price in
the metropolitan market. Trust to
him for having retained sundry <em>souvenirs</em>
of grouse, blackcock, mallard,
and plover—besides a hare’s lug, in
affectionate remembrance of some departed
maukin. And do not, unless
you are a justice of the peace, be hard
upon the poor fellow for obeying, in a
moderate way, the impulses of his
nature. He is not by any means to
be confounded with those brutal
bludgeoneers who harbour in towns,
and go out methodically in gangs to
poach. He is simply an Indian in
disposition, very kind to his colley
and affectionate to his child, passionately
fond of tobacco, whether in the
shape of snuff or pigtail, and on the
best possible terms with a brother
Celt, whose dwelling is supposed to
be subterraneous, and impregnable to
the curiosity of the exciseman. We
say, do not be hard with him, for
were he merely a clodhopper, he could
not busk a fly.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is also another kind of fishing
to be had in the salt-water lochs,
which is not without its attraction,
although, as Mr Colquhoun observes,
it is not the daintiest in the world.
We mean the fishing with the long-line
which we have seen practised
with great success both in Loch Long
and Loch Fine, and which is worth
the attention of the sportsman. Let
us hear our author upon it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The eel-line, already noticed, is precisely
the long-line in miniature with the
exception of the hooks, which are such
coarse, blunt-looking weapons, that the
wonder is how they catch at all. They
are sold for a mere trifle at any of the
shops in the seaport towns, and tied on
with a wax end, but sometimes only
with a knot of the twine itself: a turn
of the wire on the shank enables you to
do this. A baiting-basket is required,
one end for the line, the other for the
baited hooks, which are placed in regular
rows. My line had only three hundred
hooks, but some have double that number.
Herring, cut into small pieces, are
the best bait: I required about a dozen
for one setting, provided I eked out with
mussels, but eighteen or twenty were
necessary if the line was baited exclusively
with herring. Mussels, however,
drop off the hook so easily, that when
herring can be procured they are seldom
used. Seeing the long-line baited, set,
and drawn, will thoroughly teach any
one who has an idea of fishing—<em>writing</em>
how to do so, never will. It generally
took me about an hour and a half to bait
mine; so I taught a boy, who, after two
or three lessons, could bait as well as
myself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The best time to set the long-line is
after low water, when the tide has flowed
a little, and brought the fish with it. To
know the different ‘hauls’ is most important,
as your success in a great measure
depends upon the selection of a good
one. After the line is set, <em>it should be
left exactly one hour</em>; and, if you have hit
upon a shoal, you will most likely half
fill the boat. I have several times killed
about a dozen, from twenty to fifty pounds’
weight, besides quantities of smaller.
The fish for the most part taken are
cod, ling, haddock, skate, large flounders,
and enormous conger-eels—some of the
latter more than half the length of your
boat, and as thick as a man’s leg. These
would generally be thrown back again,
were it not for the havoc they make
among the other fish, and the damage
they do to the set lines. Their throats,
therefore, are cut as soon as they are
pulled up, after which operation they
will live for hours. The skate is also
very tenacious of life; and nothing can be
more absurd than the grotesque pompous
faces it will continue to exhibit for some
time after being deposited in the
boat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here Mr Colquhoun becomes slightly
libellous—comparing the countenances
of the unhappy skate to those
of functionaries on the bench. Now
we happen to have seen a moribund
skate or two, but we never were impressed
with such resemblance. We
admit, however, that we have seen
countenances under wigs look exceeding
dolorous and fish-like when
their party was going out of office.</p>

<p class='c008'>But enough of this kind of fishing,
which is, after all, too strictly professional
for our taste. We prefer the
rod and fly; and even in the salt
water the angler may use such implements,
though in a coarser form
than that to which he is accustomed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of all apologies for a fly, this (the
white feather) is the clumsiest. It is only
a swan’s or goose’s feather tied round a
large and very coarse bait-hook, without
the least pretence to art: any man who
had never dressed a fly in his life would
be as successful in the attempt as the
most finished performer. The rod and
line are in perfect keeping with the fly;
a bamboo cane, or young hazel tree, with
ten or twelve yards of oiled cord, and a
length or two of double or triple gut next
the hook: no reel is used.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The fish generally caught in this way
are lythe and seithe, although mackarel
will rise freely also. When fishing for
the former, good double gut may be
strong enough; but if large fish are expected,
I should always recommend
triple. Seithe take best in the morning
and evening, and a light breeze is rather
an advantage: although the fly is sometimes
sunk a little with lead, it is more
often fished with at the top. You may
begin at any state of the tide, and row
over all the sunk banks and places where
the fish frequent, at a slow rate, with
three or four rods placed regularly in the
stern of the boat. When a small seithe
is hooked, pull it in at once, and out with
the rod again as fast as possible; sometimes
nearly all the rods have a fish at
the same time. In lythe fishing, you
need not launch your boat until lowwater;
sink the fly with a couple of buckshot,
and troll on the brow where it
descends perpendicularly; this is easily
seen at that state of the tide. When you
hook a large fish, try to prevent it getting
down, or you may be obliged to throw
the rod overboard, in case the lythe
should break away; but, if you can
manage to swing it about at the top for
a short time, it will soon be unable to
offer any resistance.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Trolling with the white feather has
this recommendation, that it may be
enjoyed by an invalid or party of ladies—and,
certainly, a more delightful way of
spending the cool of a summer evening
cannot be imagined; rowing slowly along
those romantic shores—hearing the distant
gurgle of the dwindled mountain-brook
in its steep descent, and ever and
anon passing the blue curling smoke of a
shepherd’s or fisherman’s grass-topped
hut upon the banks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Four times has that detestable
door-bell rung; and on each occasion
we have heard the murmur of voices
below, the shuffling of feet, and the
tinkling of tumblers. Our hospitality,
we begin to fear, has been grossly
abused—all the canvassers in the
neighbourhood are flocking to our
tap—and we are not without some
misgivings that we may have incurred
the statutory penalties for treating.
There goes the bell again! Who the
deuce can it be now? Surely we have
liquored impartially every Trojan and
Tyrian in the district. Well—who is
it?</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Chairman of Mr Macwheedle’s
Committee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tell the Chairman of Mr Macwheedle’s
Committee that we are at
this moment slightly delirious, and
practising with pistols in the attics.
Hint to him, moreover, that we have
an unfortunate habit of firing down
into the lobby whenever we hear a
noise, and that we may possibly mistake
him for a rhinoceros. And give
no more beer, on any account, to any
human being. We trust, now, we
may be permitted to remain undisturbed,
and finish our article in
peace.</p>

<p class='c008'>On glancing round the attic, we
observe that our rifle, and double-barrelled
Dickson, have lain untouched
since November last. We
must look to this gear speedily; for
time is stealing on, and the twelfth
of August will be upon us before we
have recovered from the heat of these
elections. We intend, weather permitting,
to knock down on that day as many
brace as may correspond with Lord
Derby’s majority—and the news of
the result of the first contested election
in England should arrive about
this time. Indeed, we suppose it has
arrived, for there is an unusual sound
in the street, and a bawling as of
triumphant partisans. We open the
window, peer over, and behold a
frantic Constitutionalist gesticulating
like a windmill. What is the row
down there? “<span class='sc'>The two Conservative
candidates returned for
Liverpool by an immense majority!</span>”
Heaven be praised! Mr
Cardwell has got his gruel at last.
Go home, our fine fellow, and try, if
possible, to keep sober. At the same
time, we consider it necessary to
dedicate a special bumper in honour
of this event, for first blood is always
a great point in a battle. With
three cheers, which startle the swallows
from their equanimity, we drink
to the health of the electors of Liverpool,
who have so nobly done their
duty; and to that of Messrs Turner
and Forbes Mackenzie, their staunch
and worthy representatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>If this sort of thing goes on, we
shall have work before us on the
Twelfth. On that day, many an
unfledged sportsman will take the
hillside for the first time; and for
their benefit we transcribe a few sentences,
by way of precept, from Mr
Colquhoun’s book. Let them, however,
read diligently the whole of his
chapter upon grouse and black game
shooting, and we promise them that,
by adopting his suggestions, they
will bring home a heavier bag than
they could secure by following the
advice of any other mentor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Most young shots are not content
unless they are upon the moor by peep
of day, on the long-anticipated 12th of
August. And what is the result? They
have found and disturbed most of the
packs before they have well fed, and one
half will rise out of distance, and fly
away unbroken. Had the moor been
left quiet till eight or nine o’clock, four
double shots might have been obtained
at almost every pack, and many would
have been scattered for the evening
shooting. It will generally be found
that if two equal shots, upon equal
moors, uncouple their dogs, one at five
o’clock and the other at eight, and compare
notes at two in the afternoon, the
lazy man will have the heaviest game-bag,
and his ground will be in best order
for the deadly time of the day, to say
nothing of his competitor’s disadvantage
from having fruitlessly wasted his own
strength and that of his dogs, when many
of the packs would not allow him to
come within reach. My advice, therefore,
to the young grouse-shooter, is always
to wait till the dew is dry on the
heather. If he starts at eight o’clock,
and travels the moors as he ought, there
is time enough before dark to put his
powers to the proof, however he may
pique himself upon them. I do not mean
to say he must run over the ground, but
keep up a steady, determined walk, up
hill and down hill, without flagging for
an instant, unless the dogs come upon
the scent of game. Of all sports, grouse-shooting
is the most laborious. None
can stand a comparison with it except
deer-stalking; and yet the veriest “soft,”
puffing and blowing at every step, may
put off a whole day upon the moors—travelling
them, I will not call it—and
boast after dinner that “he wonders how
people can find grouse-shooting so toilsome
and fatiguing—<em>fox-hunting</em> is much
more so.””</p>

<p class='c013'>This, however, with all deference
to Mr Colquhoun, requires to be received
with qualification. One man
may work himself very nearly to
death at grouse-shooting with no more
success than another who takes it
leisurely. If you go out with numerous
relays of dogs, letting loose a
couple, or perhaps three high-bred
and far-ranging pointers at a time,
you will undoubtedly, on any average
moor, get exercise enough to knock
you up long before the day is over.
You must necessarily walk up to
every point, whether it be a real one
or not; and great is your travel accordingly.
Our method is different.
We never let out more than one dog
at a time. The very best of dogs are
not improved by emulation, especially
at the beginning of the season. They
stand upon the honour of their noses;
and, rather than not make points, will
take up the faintest scent out of sheer
jealousy of each other; whereas a
single dog knows that he is in a situation
of trust, and will not willingly
betray you. Contrary to the popular
dogma, we prefer a setter to a pointer.
The former is a more intelligent and
docile animal than the latter, and, if
you take proper pains with him, will
always understand you better, and
accommodate himself accordingly.
The only disadvantage of setters is
that they require water, and are liable
to be much distressed when the
moor is particularly dry. Still we
give them the preference over the
other; and, if you have your dog
fully under command, you will kill
as many birds over him, with infinitely
less fatigue to yourself, as if
you were to let out three. Of course
you must take care not to let him be
overworked; for there are limits to
the endurance of every living creature,
however willing he may be. A
really good dog will not give in
readily, for he enjoys the sport as
much as you do yourself. And here
we would entreat our young friends
to beware how they are harsh to their
dogs. Be kind to your dog, and he
will love you more sincerely and less
selfishly than almost any human being.
Do not be in a hurry to conclude
that he is stupid. Nature has
gifted him with a nose in many respects
superior to your own; and he
is far more likely to be in the right
than you are. Some faults there are
undoubtedly which you must check,
but never with unnecessary harshness.
No more hideously brutal picture
can be conceived than that of a
hulking fellow in fustian, with a
flushed face and angry voice, belabouring
a prostrate pointer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Colquhoun has some very sensible
observations on the instinct of
dogs, which we transcribe for the
benefit of those who think that a
pointer or a setter can display no
sagacity except in the field.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is often amusing to hear those who
know little about the subject describing
the ‘almost reason’ of the St Bernard’s
dog, and not unfrequently of the Scotch
‘colley.’ It appears to me that the instinct
of these animals is more prominently
forced upon their notice, and they
do not take the trouble to watch and
discover it in the other species. Sagacity
is more equally distributed among
the different varieties of the dog than
such casual observers are aware of; but
it, of course, takes different directions,
according to the temper, habits, and treatment
of the animal. It would be a waste
of time so far to control the keen tempers
of sporting-dogs (by which I mean
setters and pointers) as to make them
perform the duties of a well broke phlegmatic
retriever. The instinctive power
may therefore appear greater in one than
the other; but from the quiet, easy temper
of the retriever, it is much less difficult
to develop and make use of his instinct
in that particular way: while the
setter and pointer, owing to their more
active life and hunting propensities, may
often pass unnoticed, even by their masters,
though every time they are in the
field displaying as much tact as the most
cautious retriever. Their sagacity is
never thought of; and the only praise
they get is that they are ‘excellent
dogs;’ which means <em>that they find plenty
of game</em>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is another reason why sporting-dogs
appear more deficient in sense
than some others, and that is their mode
of life. Confined always in the kennel
unless when seeking game, all their powers
are employed to this end. There
are, however, abundant proofs that, when
made companions, and suffered to occupy
a place upon the hearth-rug, they are
capable of the same attachment, and
would equal in sagacity the much-lauded
dogs of St Bernard. Indeed, the usual
mode of imprisoning sporting-dogs is so
great a disadvantage, that I have seen
some, with excellent noses, and every requisite
for the moors, grow sulky, and
refuse to hunt with their usual freeness,
unless left in a great measure to themselves.
This, I know, arose partly from
a want of proper management, and not
keeping the medium between encouraging
kindness and merited correction; for
too much lenity is nearly as injurious to
a dog as over-severity: sulkiness will
often be the effect in the one case, shyness
in the other. Still, if the dog were
allowed to be the companion of his master,
he would both acquire sense and
tact in half the time, and would not give
half the trouble either by shyness or sulkiness;
whereas it will generally be
found that a kennel-dog is long past his
best before he excels in that sagacity on
the moor which so greatly assists him in
finding game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In short, the dog who knows his
master, and is familiar with his ways,
will always do his work more satisfactorily
than the poor beast who has
passed the greater number of his
days in the monotony of the kennel,
and who never has had the advantage
of being introduced to human society.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have not, however, adverted
to the points raised by Mr Colquhoun
as to taking the moors early. There
can be no doubt that he is right, in
the advice which he tenders to young
sportsmen. Early-rising we believe
to be a virtue, though one which we
do not practise with sufficient exactitude;
and we have heard it stated,
on credible authority, that nature
looks lovely at sunrise. But for all
that, there is no occasion whatever
for awakening the echoes by a premature
discharge of musketry. Grouse
must breakfast like other living
creatures, and it is but fair to allow
them, on this the day of their annual
massacre, the privilege of a matutinal
picking. As to your own breakfast,
we certainly should not recommend
you to victual yourself as if you were
stowing away provisions to last you
for a couple of days; but, on the
other hand, go not forth famished.
Mr Colquhoun recommends you to
forego the companionship of a flask.
We dissent. If the weather is boiling,
and if you are not accustomed to
violent exercise, you must necessarily
drink something; and the safest
beverage is water slightly tinctured
with spirits. Beer blows you up,
and porter makes you sleepy. Cold
tea is trash. Of course you will take
care not to increase your hereditary
thirst by cramming yourself at
luncheon with ham, or any of those
high-spiced delicacies which Italian
warehousemen especially recommend
for the moors. Eat anchovies, and
in a quarter of an hour after you
have resumed your beat, you will
find that you had better have tasted
of the apples of the Dead Sea. And
here we shall remark that the proceedings
of the previous evening have
often much to do with these distressing
symptoms of thirst. Of all days
in the year we regard the eleventh
of August as that which should be
most soberly observed; and we
earnestly counsel our young friends,
if they have any regard for their own
comfort, to resist on that evening the
most pressing hospitality which may
be offered them by a seasoned Thane.
Besides this, young sportsmen are
commonly nervous enough on their
first field-day, without doing anything
additional to make their hand
unsteady; and it is well known to
authorities, that, whereas the man who
begins by shooting well in the morning
commonly continues to do so
throughout the day, the unfortunate
lad who signalises himself by a series
of misses at the commencement very
rarely regains coolness enough to
enable him to do any execution.
He becomes flurried and anxious,
takes no deliberate aim, fires at any
kind of distance, and, not unfrequently,
puts the life of Ponto into
jeopardy extreme.</p>

<p class='c008'>Black-cock shooting is a much
tamer sport than that afforded by the
quest of the grouse. Nevertheless,
as an old cock is a handsome bird
to look at, and withal heavy, though
he makes but an indifferent addition
to the table, the young sportsman is
usually desirous to bring him to bag.
On this subject we have a word or two
to say. Great care should be taken
not to disturb the young broods before
the twentieth of August—indeed, in
our opinion, the twentieth of August
is quite early enough to begin. The
places where black game hatch, and
in which the young broods continue
until they are well grown, are quite
distinct from those frequented by the
grouse. You may expect to find the
former in tracts of rushy ground, in
little glens where the fern grows abundantly,
or in low brushwood; whereas
the latter are always to be sought for
among the heather. Young black
game lie so close that it is sometimes
easy to take them with the hand
just under the nose of the pointer—indeed
the pointer is often tempted
to break rules, and make a grab at
the living simpleton who will not
flutter up. At the commencement
of the season it is always best to
keep the higher ground, so that the
dogs may not interfere with the black
in their quest for the red game; and
afterwards, in every case where the
birds are not fully grown, we supplicate
for mercy for the maternal
grey hen. Indeed, the sportsman
will find it to his advantage to give
her a reprieve; for young black game
are very helpless creatures, and, if
deprived of their mother’s superintendence
before they are well fledged,
are apt to fall victims to some of their
natural enemies, who are perpetually on
the prowl. As for the old cocks, down
with them whenever you can. They
are quite able to look after themselves,
are exceedingly wary, and, if
you happen to find them in the
bracken or brushwood, will afford
you a charming right and left. Towards
the close of the season, stalking
blackcock is a very exciting
sport. It requires great caution and
skill—for our sable acquaintances
are knowing strategists, and always
appoint a sentinel. Driving blackcock
is another method which we
have practised with considerable
success, both in Argyllshire and on
the Border, where this species of
game especially abounds; and we
can answer for the excellence of the
sport. These remarks apply to the
circumventing of the old birds—the
pursuit of young black game is very
tame work. They always rise within
easy distance, and fly so steadily that
the merest tyro can bring them
down; whereas the acuter grouse,
after he has been once or twice disturbed,
seems to form a very accurate
estimate of the nature and purposes
of a gun, and endeavours to get out of
your way without cultivating a nearer
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are bound to confess that we
never shot a ptarmigan; and, judging
from Mr Colquhoun’s account of two
expeditions which he made in search
of that Alpine bird, we have little inclination
to follow his example. The
ptarmigan, or white grouse, is only
found near the summits of the loftiest
mountains in Scotland; and, when
roused, he has a playful habit of crossing
from one peak to another, so that,
if you wish to follow him up, you
must ascend a second Jungfrau. Now,
we have no idea of this kind of elevation;
for one would require to be a
sort of Giant of the Hartz, able to
stride from mountain to mountain, in
order to pursue such erratic game.
Alpine hares are more to the purpose;
and as we believe English sportsmen
are not well acquainted with the habits
of this animal, which, of late years,
has been greatly on the increase in
some districts of Scotland, we may
perhaps transcribe with advantage
the remarks of Mr Colquhoun.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The white hare inhabits many of our
mountains. It is not confined, like the
ptarmigan, to the tops of the highest and
most inaccessible, but, on the contrary, is
often met with on grouse-shooting ranges,
where there are few crags or rocks to be
seen. I have frequently shot it on flats,
between the hills, where it had made its
form like the common hare; and, though
I have more often moved it in rocky
places—where it sometimes has its seat a
considerable way under a stone—I do
not think it ever burrows among them,
as some suppose; for, although hard
pressed, I have never seen it attempt to
shelter itself, like a rabbit, in that way.
Indeed there would be little occasion for
this, as its speed is scarcely inferior to
the hares of the wood or plain, and it
evidently possesses more cunning. When
first started, instead of running heedlessly
forward, it makes a few corky bounds,
then stops to listen, moving its ears about;
and, if the danger is urgent, darts off at
full speed, always with the settled purpose
of reaching some high hill or craggy
ravine. If not pressed, it springs along
as if for amusement; but takes care never
to give its enemy an advantage by
loitering.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I put up one on the 16th March 1840,
when inspecting the heather-burning on
my moor, at Leny in Perthshire, which
(contrary to their usual practice) kept
watching, and allowed me several times
to come within a hundred yards. I was
at first surprised, but the explanation
soon occurred to me that it had young
ones in the heather. I had thus a good
opportunity of noticing the commencement
of its change of colour. The head
was quite grey, and the back nearly so;
which parts are the last to lose, as well
as the first to put on, the summer dress.
I shot one nearly in the same stage, on
the 22d November 1839. The only difference
was that the whole coat of the
former appeared less pure. This is easily
accounted for, as in winter the creature,
though recovering a fresh accession of
hair, loses none of the old, which also
becomes white; whereas in spring it casts
it all, like other animals. Thus, by a
merciful provision, its winter covering is
doubly thick; while, at the same time,
being the colour of snow, (with which our
hills are generally whitened at that time
of year,) it can more easily elude its
numerous foes. The same remark applies
to the ptarmigan.</p>

<p class='c016'>“During a mild winter, when the ground
is free from snow, the white hare invariably
chooses the thickest patch of heather
it can find, as if aware of its conspicuous
appearance; and to beat all the bushy
tufts on the side and at the foot of rocky
hills at such a time affords the best chance
of a shot. The purity or dinginess of its
colour is a true criterion of the severity
or mildness of the season. If the winter
is open, I have always remarked that the
back and lower part of the ears retain a
shade of the fawn-colour; if, on the contrary,
there is much frost and snow, the
whole fur of the hare is very bright and
silvery, with scarcely a tint of brown.
When started from its form, I have constantly
observed that it never returns,
evidently knowing that its refuge has
been discovered. It will sometimes burrow
in the snow, in order to scrape for
food and avoid the cold wind, as well as
for security. These burrows are not
easily discovered by an unaccustomed
eye; the hare runs round the place several
times, which completely puzzles an
observer, and then makes a bound over,
without leaving any footmark to detect
her retreat. It is hollowed out, like a
mine, by the hare’s scraping and breath,
and the herbage beneath nibbled bare.</p>

<p class='c016'>“When deer-stalking in Glenartney
last autumn, I was quite amazed at the
multitude of Alpine hares. They kept
starting up on all sides—some as light-coloured
as rabbits, and others so dark as
to resemble little moving pieces of granite.
I could only account for their numbers
from the abundance of fine green
food, and the absence of sheep; which
are as much avoided by hares as by deer,
from their dirting the ground with their
tarry fleeces.</p>

<p class='c016'>“An eye-witness, on whom I can depend,
gave me a curious account of the
tactics of a hill-hare, which completely
baffled the tyrant of the rocks. Puss, as
is her wont when chased by an eagle,
sheltered herself under a stone. The
eagle took post at a little distance, and
watched long, exactly like a cat waiting
for a mouse. Although her fierce foe
was out of sight, the hare seemed to have
a <em>mesmeric</em> knowledge of his vicinity, for
she never would move so far from her
hiding-place as to be taken by surprise.
Several times she came out to feed, but
the moment the eagle rose she was safe
again. At last her pursuer got tired,
and flew away. The white hare has
always a refuge of this kind where eagles
haunt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We may add that the Alpine hare
is now most abundant in some districts
of Perthshire, and that it is
easily shot, by the sportsman taking
post at the outlet of one of the large
enclosures of hill pasture, while the
ground within is beat. This, of
course, is inglorious shooting; but
fellows who are not up to the ready
use of firearms like it; and we should
be inclined to bet that even Mr John
Bright would, once out of twenty-five
trials, contrive to hit a hare. We
shall not rashly predicate the like
of his friend Mr Welford, unless
the hares were taken sitting; and,
even in that case, we have great
doubts whether the arch-enemy and
would-be extirpator of game would
succeed; for we have an idea that he
entertains a vague notion that the
recoil of a fowling-piece is something
absolutely terrific.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the way, what has become of
Welford? It is now several years
since we had occasion to notice his
work on the game-laws with marked
amenity; but, since then, we have
lost sight of that Pleiad. Is it possible
that he can have been converted
to our views, in consequence of his
having been graciously permitted by
the member for the West Riding to
sport over his extensive estates?
We hope so, and do not despair to
see him ere long upon the mountains
with a philabeg girt round his loins.
Having begun such a crusade against
the <em>feræ naturæ</em>, he ought to consummate
it with his own hand. Theseus
was supposed to have rid the Peloponnesus
of ravening beasts—why
should not Welford exterminate the
objects of his wrath, and put an end
to the ornithology of Great Britain?</p>

<p class='c008'>So long as moor and loch remain—and
it will be a considerable time
before the one is thoroughly reclaimed,
and the other thoroughly drained, in
Scotland—there is little probability
that any of the animals native to our
country will utterly perish before the
exertions of the Manchester gentry.
Indeed it is worth while remarking
that modern improvement, by replacing
the woods, has again brought back
to districts the game which for centuries
had disappeared. Within our
recollection, a roe-deer had never been
seen by a living man south of Forth;
now they are not uncommon within
twelve miles of Edinburgh, and probably
will soon spread to the Border,
and beyond it. The roe is no great
delicacy for the table—though the
Germans think otherwise, and dress
it with considerable skill—nor might
it satisfy the requirements of an aldermanic
appetite; but no one who has
seen those elegant creatures bounding
through a Highland wood, or stealing
out at evening to feed beyond the
coppice, can deny the charm which
they add to the beauties of our northern
landscape. We fairly confess
that we never, even in the heyday
and excitement of our youth, have
shot a roe without experiencing a
pang of regret. But roes, according
to the views of Welford, must not be
allowed to multiply indefinitely; and
therefore we have endeavoured at
times, when they became too thick,
and would persevere in barking the
trees, to do our duty. We shall not
extract anything from Mr Colquhoun’s
chapter upon roe-hunting, which we
recommend to the attention of those
who may shortly have occasion to try
that sport; but we cannot pass over
a little Highland picture in which the
roe is a prominent figure.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Day was just breaking when I crossed
the river Tulla, on my way to Peter
Robertson’s cottage. He was standing
before his door, consoling himself for his
early start by a pipe of very strong
tobacco. The morning was all we could
wish—calm, grey, and mild. As we
passed the banks of the loch, roe-deer
were quietly cropping the greensward,
which sloped to the water’s edge, and
now and then a fine buck would raise his
head, and look listlessly over his shoulder,
as if wondering what business we had to
be so early astir. The blackcock, surrounded
by his hens, was crooning his
antics on the tops of the knolls, and was
answered by the redcock, with many a
cheery but eccentric call, from the more
distant heights. A male hen-harrier
was flitting stealthily above the heather,
seeking his breakfast where it could
easily be found, with small chance of
human company at his morning meal.
Now and then an Alpine hare would
canter lazily away, or raise herself upon
her hind-legs to listen, moving about her
inquisitive ears.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A perfect and most graphic Highland
picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the naturalist, the most puzzling
of all questions is to define accurately
the limits between instinct and reason,
as the terms are commonly understood.
We have long ago given up the attempt
in absolute despair. Take, for
example, the case of the rooks. They
can distinguish Sunday from the rest
of the week as accurately as any precentor,
and are perfectly aware that,
on that day, no gun will be levelled
at them. You may make demonstrations
with a stick if you please,
but the rooks will not fly away.
They merely retort with a caw of
utter scorn. But on Monday morning
the Lord of Rookwood is a changed
being. He will not on any account
let you within a hundred yards of
him; and so excessively acute is he,
that you would almost swear he
scents the powder in your pocket.
So is it with the roes. When wandering
unarmed through a Highland
wood, you are almost certain to fall
in with several of these beautiful
creatures, who regard you almost
without alarm, and glide slowly into
the shaw. They know quite well
that you are not there with any murderous
design, and they neither fear
nor avoid you. Not so if you carry
a gun. In that case, you may look
long enough about you before you
will descry the white spot, which is
the distinguishing mark of the roe-deer.
They whom you seek are
lying close in the brackens, perhaps
but a very few yards from you, but
they will not stir till you are gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beating for roe is stupid work. We
do not see the fun of standing for
half the day in a pass waiting for a
chance shot, with no other regalement
for the ear than the hoarse
braying of the beaters, and their
everlasting shouts of “Shoo!” A
much better method is that of stirring
the roe with a foxhound, when he
glides from thicket to thicket, in advance
of his pursuer, whose clear
note indicates his approach, and gives
you sufficient warning. But enough
on this head.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have already, in former articles,
while reviewing the works of Mr St
John and the Stuarts, had occasion
to enter pretty fully into the subject
of deer-stalking. Therefore we shall
not again go over that ground, although
tempted to do so by Mr Colquhoun’s
admirable chapter devoted
to that noble sport, in which he lays
down, with great perspicuity, all the
rules which ought to be observed by the
stalker. To such of our readers as
aspire to have their exploits chronicled
in the columns of the <cite>Inverness
Courier</cite>, (the best sporting register
in Scotland,) we recommend Mr Colquhoun’s
book, advising them to
study it well before they venture
forth into the mountains. It is true
that no theory can supply the lack of
practice; still, deer-stalking is eminently
an art; and there are distinct
rules for following it, which must not
be disregarded. Mr Colquhoun is
more concise than any former writer,
and we prefer him, as a guide, to Mr
Scrope.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a very curious chapter devoted
to the chase of the wild goat,
which may now be considered among
the <em>feræ naturæ</em> of Scotland. They
exist in some of the islands of Loch
Lomond, and, if we mistake not, on
the hills of Ross-shire, near Loch
Luichart. Some years ago, there
were several wild goats on the tremendous
precipices at the entrance of
the Bay of Cromarty; but they were
assailed in their fastnesses both from
sea and land, and, for aught we
know, may have been exterminated.
We beg, however, to caution our
English friends against firing at every
goat they may chance to fall in with
in their rambles among the hills. In
many parts of the Highlands goats
are kept as stock—indeed, it is probable
that the kind now considered
as wild were originally stragglers
from some flock. In the course of
two or three generations they have
lost all trace of a domestic character,
and can neither be claimed nor reclaimed.
But it is not safe for sportsmen
to exercise their judgment upon
this point, without distinct local information,
lest, perchance, they should
happen to smite down an appropriated
Billy in his pride. We have known
some awkward mistakes occurring
with regard to geese, who had somewhat
imprudently exhibited themselves
on the bosom of a mountain
tarn.</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot read the chapter entitled
“Crap-na-Gower,” containing
an account of an exterminating warfare
against the goats on one of the
Loch Lomond islands, without wishing
that they had been allowed to
remain, at whatever injury to the
trees. Mr Colquhoun, who always
writes as a humane gentleman ought
to do, virtually admits that he does
not plume himself on the share which
he took in that crusade; and there is
something very melancholy in the
picture which he draws of the death-scene
of the last Billy. We can fully
understand the feeling which prompts
men of an exceedingly tender and
sensitive disposition to abstain from
field sports altogether. The idea of
giving pain to any living creature is
to them intolerable; and we believe
there are few sportsmen who have
not in their own minds experienced
occasional misgivings. Abhorring, as
we do, all manner of cruelty, it does
seem at first sight strange and unnatural,
that a person feeling thus,
should seek amusement or recreation
in depriving living creatures of their
existence. But we altogether deny
that there is any ferocity in the chase.
We are led to it by a natural instinct,
powerful in the savage, but which
civilisation has no power to obliterate;
and that instinct was doubtless given
to us, as were the brute creation to
man, for wise and useful purposes.
Those who argue that there is inhumanity
in field sports, seldom reflect
on their own inconsistency. Either
they must maintain—which none of
them do—that wild animals should be
allowed to multiply indefinitely, in
which case foxes, foumarts, and stoats,
would share in the general amnesty,
not to mention such an increase in
the number of hares as would annihilate
agriculture; or they must, as
some of them certainly do, assert
their right to cut off a branch of
creation from the earth. The argument
for field sports lies midway between
unrestricted multiplicity and
total extermination. Now, surely it
is better that a grouse should have its
lease of life and enjoyment, and afterwards
be swiftly shot down for the
use of man, than that there should be
no grouse at all. Your modern advocate
for total clearance is, in fact, as
gross a barbarian as the brute who
deliberately sets his foot upon a nest
of eggs, for the avowed purpose of
preventing so much development of
animal existence. He is, in heart at
least, a chick-murderer. He opposes
himself to the economy of creation;
and would, on his own responsibility,
make a new arrangement of the
zoology of the globe, on principles
entirely his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be a great relief to us if
those Homeridæ, who have been
screaming satirical panegyrics on
Macwheedle beneath our window, for
the last hour or two, would withdraw
themselves and their minstrelsy.
Such canorous vagabonds do a great
deal of mischief. The satirified individual,
who is, in reality, a very
poor creature, suddenly finds himself
swelled into importance, by being
chaunted ironically in the streets;
and is apt to imbibe the notion that
he is, after all, a fit and proper person
to be returned to Parliament.
So far as we have been able to gather
the meaning of the words, these
effusions seem to be couched in the
veriest doggrel; but, for all that,
they are emanations from the popular
mind, symptomatic of the coming result
of the poll, and we so receive them.
Against Macwheedle we are ready to
lay any manner of odds, for no minstrel’s
throat, as yet, has vibrated
decidedly in his praise. We hope,
however, that the shilling, which
we willingly tender, may procure us
immunity, for an hour or two, from
this hideous irruption of song.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hitherto we have adverted mainly,
for the benefit of those who are
untried in the ways of the Moor and
the Loch, to the earlier sports of the
season; because we are in favour of
what Dandie Dinmont termed a
“regular entering,” and have no idea
of dispensing with principles at the
commencement of the sportsman’s
career. Old hands know perfectly
well what is before them. Such a
work as this, which we are reviewing,
may possibly confirm some of their
theories, or it may reveal to them the
cause—especially in winter shooting—of
some errors into which they may
have inadvertently fallen from too
slight notice of the habits and peculiar
sensitiveness of their game. Mr
Colquhoun’s observations on this point
are peculiarly valuable; for, dwelling
on the banks of one of the most beautiful
of our Scottish lochs, he has had
ample opportunity to study the movements
of the aquatic birds which
congregate there in the winter season.
The reader must not expect to
find such narratives of wholesale
slaughter among ducks and widgeon
as embellish the pages of Colonel
Hawker. Punt-shooting is limited
to the sea-shores and harbours; and
we can readily conceive it to be an
exciting occupation for those who are
hardy enough to take the mud at
midnight, regardless of the state of
the thermometer. But duck-shooting,
on a Highland loch, partakes
more of the nature of stalking, and
calls forth in an eminent degree the
skill and resources of the hunter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Having now equipped our wildfowl
shooter, we will again bring him to the
shore. His first object should be to see
his game without being seen himself,
even if they are at too great a distance
to show signs of alarm. To effect this
he must creep cautiously forward to the
first point that will command a view of
the shore for some distance; then, taking
out his glass, he must reconnoitre it by
inches, noticing every tuft of grass or
stone, to which wildfowl asleep often
bear so close a resemblance, that, except
to a very quick eye, assisted by a glass,
the difference is not perceptible. If the
loch be well-frequented, he will most
likely first discover a flock of divers,
but must not be in a hurry to pocket his
glass, until he has thoroughly inspected
the shore, in case some more desirable
fowl may be feeding or asleep upon it.
I will suppose that he sees some objects
that <em>may</em> be wildfowl. Let him then
immediately direct his glass to the very
margin of the loch, to see if anything is
moving there. Should he find it so, he
may conclude that it is a flock of either
duck, widgeon, or teal; those first perceived
resting on the shore, and the others
feeding at the water’s edge—of course
not nearly so conspicuous. If there is
no motion at the margin of the loch he
must keep his glass fixed, and narrowly
watch for some time, when, if what
arrested his attention be wildfowl asleep,
they will, in all probability, betray
themselves by raising a head or flapping
a wing.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He must now take one or two large
marks, that he will be sure to know
again, as close to the birds as possible;
and also another, about two or three
hundred yards immediately above, further
inland. Having done this, let him take
a very wide circle and come round upon
his inland mark. He must now walk
as if treading upon glass; the least
rustle of a bough, or crack of a piece of
rotten wood under his feet, may spoil
all, especially if the weather be calm.
Having got to about one hundred yards
from where he supposes the birds to be,
he will tell his retriever to lie down;
the dog, if well trained, will at once do
so, and never move. His master will
then crawl forward, until he gets the
advantage of a bush or tuft of reeds, and
then raise his head by inches to look
through it for his other marks. Having
seen them, he has got an idea where the
birds are, and will, with the utmost
caution, endeavour to catch sight of
them. I will suppose him fortunate
enough to do so, and that they are perfectly
unconscious of his near approach.
He must lower his head in the same
cautious manner, and look for some refuge
at a fair distance from the birds,
through which he may fire the deadly sitting
shot. After creeping serpent-like to
this, he will again raise his head by
hair-breadths, and, peeping through the
bush or tuft, select the greatest number
of birds in line; then drawing back a
little, in order that his gun may be just
clear of the bush for the second barrel,
after having fired the first through it,
will take sure aim at his selected victims.
Should he unfortunately not find an
opening to fire through, the only other
alternative is by almost imperceptible
degrees to raise his gun to the right of
the bush, and close to it; but in doing
this the birds are much more likely to
see him, and take wing. Never fire
<em>over</em> the bush, as you are almost certain
to be perceived whenever you raise your
head: more good shots are lost to an
experienced hand by a rapid jerk, not
keeping a sufficient watch for stragglers,
and over-anxiety to fire, than in any
other way. Having succeeded in getting
the sitting shot, the fowl, especially if
they have not seen from whence it comes,
will rise perpendicularly in the air, and
you are not unlikely to have a chance of
knocking down a couple more with your
second barrel; but if they rise wide, you
must select the finest old mallard among
them, or whatever suits your fancy.
Directly upon hearing the report, your
retriever will run to your assistance,
and, having secured your cripples, you
will reload, and, taking out your glass, reconnoitre
again; for though ducks, widgeon,
&#38;c., should fly out upon the loch
at the report of your gun, yet the diver
tribe, if there are only one or two together,
are perhaps more likely to be
under water than above when you fire:
but more of them by and by.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Another invariable rule, in crawling
upon ducks, is always, if possible, to get
to leeward of them; for although I am
firmly of opinion that they do not wind
you like deer, as some suppose, yet their
hearing is most acute. I have seen instances
of this that I could hardly otherwise
have credited. One day I got
within about sixty yards of three ducks
asleep upon the shore; the wind was
blowing very strong, direct from me to
them, a thick hedge forming my ambuscade.
The ground was quite bare beyond
this hedge, so I was obliged to
take the distant shot through it. In
making the attempt, I rustled one of the
twigs—up went the three heads to the
full stretch; but when I had remained
quiet for about five minutes, they again
placed their bills under their wings.
Upon a second trial, the slight noise
was unfortunately repeated—again the
birds raised their heads; but this time
they were much longer upon the stretch,
and seemed more uneasy. Nothing now
remained but to try again: my utmost
caution, however, was unavailing—the
birds rose like rockets. I never hesitate
concealing myself to windward of the
spot where I expect ducks to pitch, feeling
confident that, unless I move, they
will not find me out. I have often had
them swimming within twenty-five yards
of me, when I was waiting for three or
four in line, the wind blowing direct
from me to them, without perceiving, by
any signs, their consciousness of an
enemy’s vicinity.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Macwheedle himself, by all that’s
impudent! Nay, then, it is full time
for us to take our farewell of Mr
Colquhoun, and address ourselves to
our public duty. We shall meet
the honourable candidate in that
style of diplomacy which was imparted
to us by old Talleyrand, and
in which, we flatter ourselves, we
have no equal, with the exception,
perhaps, of the accomplished Dunshunner.
That gay individual is,
doubtless, at this moment wooing
some bashful constituency—we trust
with prospects of better success than
attended his last adventure. When
the elections are over, we shall lose
not a moment in hastening to the
Highlands—there, by glen and river,
loch, moor, and mountain, to obliterate
all memory of the heat and
hurry of the hustings; and we hope,
before the year is over, to hear from
the lips of many of our friends, who
are now looking forward with anxiety
to their first sporting season, an
acknowledgment of the benefit which
they have derived from the practical
lessons of our author. Now, then,
for an interview with the too insinuating
Macwheedle.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BOOK XI. CONTINUED—CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class='c014'>When the scenes in some long
diorama pass solemnly before us,
there is sometimes one solitary object,
contrasting, perhaps, the view of
stately cities or the march of a mighty
river, that halts on the eye for a
moment, and then glides away, leaving
on the mind a strange, comfortless,
undefined impression.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why was the object presented to
us? In itself it seemed comparatively
insignificant. It may have been but
a broken column—a lonely pool with
a star-beam on its quiet surface—yet
it awes us. We remember it when
phantasmal pictures of bright Damascus,
or of colossal pyramids—of
bazaars in Stamboul, or lengthened
caravans that defile slow amidst the
sands of Araby—have sated the wondering
gaze. Why were we detained
in the shadowy procession by a thing
that would have been so commonplace
had it not been so lone? Some
latent interest must attach to it.
Was it there that a vision of woe had
lifted the wild hair of a Prophet?—there
where some Hagar had stilled
the wail of her child on her indignant
breast? We would fain call
back the pageantry procession—fain
see again the solitary thing that
seemed so little worth the hand of
the artist—and ask, “Why art
thou here, and wherefore dost thou
haunt us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rise up—rise up once more—by
the broad great thoroughfare that
stretches onward and onward to the
remorseless London——Rise up—rise
up—O solitary tree with the green
leaves on thy bough, and the deep
rents in thy heart; and the ravens,
dark birds of omen and sorrow, that
built their nest amidst the leaves of
the bough, and drop with noiseless
plumes down through the hollow
rents of the heart—or are heard, it
may be, in the growing shadows of
twilight, calling out to their young!</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the old pollard tree, by the
side of John Avenel’s house, there
cowered, breathless and listening,
John Avenel’s daughter Nora. Now,
when that fatal newspaper paragraph,
which lied so like truth, met her eyes,
she obeyed the first impulse of her
passionate heart—she tore the wedding
ring from her finger—she enclosed
it, with the paragraph itself,
in a letter to Audley—a letter that
she designed to convey scorn and
pride—alas! it expressed only jealousy
and love. She could not rest till
she had put this letter into the post
with her own hand, addressed to
Audley at Lord Lansmere’s. Scarce
was it gone ere she repented. What
had she done?—resigned the birthright
of the child she was so soon to
bring into the world—resigned her
last hope in her lover’s honour—given
up her life of life—and from belief in
what?—a report in a newspaper!
No, no; she would go herself to Lansmere;
to her father’s home—she could
contrive to see Audley before that
letter reached his hand. The thought
was scarcely conceived before obeyed.
She found a vacant place in a coach
that started from London some hours
before the mail, and went within a few
miles of Lansmere; those last miles she
travelled on foot. Exhausted—fainting—she
gained at last the sight
of home, and there halted, for in
the little garden in front she saw
her parents seated. She heard the
murmur of their voices, and suddenly
she remembered her altered
shape, her terrible secret. How
answer the question, “Daughter,
where and who is thy husband?”
Her heart failed her; she crept under
the old pollard tree, to gather up
resolve, to watch and to listen. She
saw the rigid face of the thrifty prudent
mother, with the deep lines that
told of the cares of an anxious life,
and the chafe of excitable temper
and warm affections against the restraint
of decorous sanctimony and
resolute pride. The dear stern face
never seemed to her more dear and
more stern. She saw the comely,
easy, indolent, good-humoured father;
not then the poor, paralytic sufferer,
who could yet recognise Nora’s eyes
under the lids of Leonard, but stalwart
and jovial—first bat in the
Cricket Club, first voice in the Glee
Society, the most popular canvasser
of the Lansmere Constitutional True
Blue Party, and the pride and idol of
the Calvinistical prim wife. Never
from those pinched lips of hers had
come forth even one pious rebuke to
the careless social man. As he sate,
one hand in his vest, his profile turned
to the road, the light smoke curling
playfully up from the pipe, over
which lips, accustomed to bland smile
and hearty laughter, closed as if reluctant
to be closed at all, he was
the very model of the respectable retired
trader in easy circumstances,
and released from the toil of making
money while life could yet enjoy the
delight of spending it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, old woman,” said John
Avenel, “I must be off presently to
see to those three shaky voters in Fish
Lane; they will have done their work
soon, and I shall catch ’em at home.
They do say as how we may have an
opposition; and I know that old
Smikes has gone to Lonnon in search
of a candidate. We can’t have the
Lansmere Constitutional Blues beat
by a Lonnoner! Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you will be home before Jane
and her husband Mark come? How
ever she could marry a common carpenter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said John, “he <em>is</em> a carpenter;
but he has a vote, and that
strengthens the family interest. If
Dick was not gone to Amerikay,
there would be three on us. But
Mark is a real good Blue! A Lonnoner,
indeed!—a Yellow from Lonnon
beat my Lord and the Blues!
Ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, John, this Mr Egerton is a
Lonnoner?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t understand things,
talking such nonsense. Mr Egerton
is the Blue candidate, and the Blues
are the Country Party; therefore how
can he be a Lonnoner? An uncommon
clever, well grown, handsome
young man, eh! and my young lord’s
particular friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs Avenel sighed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you sighing and shaking
your head for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was thinking of our poor, dear,
dear Nora!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“God bless her!” cried John,
heartily.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a rustle under the boughs
of the old hollow-hearted pollard tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! ha! Hark! I said that
so loud that I have startled the
ravens!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How he did love her!” said Mrs
Avenel thoughtfully. “I am sure he
did; and no wonder, for she looks
every inch a lady; and why should
not she be my lady, after all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He? Who? Oh, that foolish
fancy of yours about my young lord?
A prudent woman like you!—stuff!
I am glad my little beauty is gone to
Lonnon, out of harm’s way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“John—John—John! No harm
could ever come to my Nora. She’s
too pure and too good, and has too
proper a pride in her, to”—</p>

<p class='c008'>“To listen to any young lords, I
hope,” said John; “though,” he
added, after a pause, “she might well
be a lady too. My lord, the young
one, took me by the hand so kindly
the other day, and said, ‘Have not
you heard from her—I mean Miss
Avenel—lately?’ and those bright
eyes of his were as full of tears as—as—as
yours are now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, John, well; go on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is all. My lady came up,
and took me away to talk about the
election; and just as I was going,
she whispered, ‘Don’t let my wild
boy talk to you about that sweet girl
of yours. We must both see that
she does not come to disgrace.’ ‘Disgrace!’
that word made me very
angry for the moment. But my lady
has such a way with her, that she
soon put me right again. Yet, I do
think Nora must have loved my
young lord, only she was too good to
show it. What do you say?” And
the father’s voice was thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope she’ll never love any man
till she’s married to him; it is not
proper, John,” said Mrs Avenel, somewhat
starchly, though very mildly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! ha!” laughed John, chucking
his prim wife under the chin,
“you did not say that to me when I
stole your first kiss under that very
pollard tree—no house near it then!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, John, hush!” and the
prim wife blushed like a girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pooh,” continued John merrily,
“I don’t see why we plain folks
should pretend to be more saintly
and prudish-like than our betters.
There’s that handsome Miss Leslie,
who is to marry Mr Egerton—easy
enough to see how much she is in
love with him—could not keep her
eyes off from him even in church, old
girl? Ha, ha! What the deuce is
the matter with the ravens?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll be a comely couple, John.
And I hear tell she has a power of
money. When is the marriage to be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, they say as soon as the election
is over. A fine wedding we shall
have of it! I dare say my young
lord will be bridesman. We’ll send
for our little Nora to see the gay
doings!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Out from the boughs of the old tree
came the shriek of a lost spirit—one
of those strange appalling sounds of
human agony, which, once heard, are
never forgotten. It is as the wail of
Hope, when <span class='sc'>She</span>, too, rushes forth
from the coffer of woes, and vanishes
into viewless space;—it is the dread
cry of Reason parting from clay—and
of Soul, that would wrench itself from
life! For a moment all was still—and
then a dull, dumb, heavy fall!</p>

<p class='c008'>The parents gazed on each other,
speechless: they stole close to the
pales, and looked over. Under the
boughs, at the gnarled roots of the
oak, they saw—grey and indistinct—a
prostrate form. John opened the
gate, and went round; the mother
crept to the roadside, and there stood
still.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, wife, wife!” cried John
Avenel, from under the green boughs,
“it is our child Nora! Our child—our
child!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, as he spoke, out from the
green boughs started the dark ravens,
wheeling round and around, and calling
to their young!</p>

<hr class='c023'>

<p class='c008'>And when they had laid her on the
bed, Mrs Avenel whispered John to
withdraw for a moment; and, with
set lips but trembling hands, began
to unlace the dress, under the pressure
of which Nora’s heart heaved
convulsively. And John went out of
the room bewildered, and sate himself
down on the landing-place, and
wondered whether he was awake or
sleeping; and a cold numbness crept
over one side of him, and his head
felt very heavy, with a loud booming
noise in his ears. Suddenly his wife
stood by his side, and said in a very
low voice—</p>

<p class='c008'>“John, run for Mr Morgan—make
haste. But mind—don’t speak to any
one on the way. Quick, quick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is she dying?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know. Why not die before?”
said Mrs Avenel between her
teeth. “But Mr Morgan is a discreet,
friendly man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A true Blue!” muttered poor
John, as if his mind wandered; and
rising with difficulty, he stared at
his wife a moment, shook his head,
and was gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour or two later, a little
covered taxed-cart stopped at Mr
Avenel’s cottage, out of which stepped
a young man with pale face and
spare form, dressed in the Sunday suit
of a rustic craftsman; then a homely,
but pleasant, honest face, bent down
to him smilingly; and two arms,
emerging from under covert of a red
cloak, extended an infant, which the
young man took tenderly. The baby
was cross and very sickly; it began
to cry. The father hushed, and
rocked, and tossed it, with the air of
one to whom such a charge was
familiar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll be good when we get in,
Mark,” said the young woman,
as she extracted from the depths of
the cart a large basket containing poultry
and home-made bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t forget the flowers that the
Squire’s gardener gave us,” said Mark
the Poet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without aid from her husband, the
wife took down basket and nosegay,
settled her cloak, smoothed her gown,
and said, “Very odd!—they don’t
seem to expect us, Mark. How still
the house is! Go and knock; they
can’t ha’ gone to bed yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mark knocked at the door—no
answer. A light passed rapidly across
the windows on the upper floor, but
still no one came to his summons.
Mark knocked again. A gentleman
dressed in clerical costume, now coming
from Lansmere Park, on the opposite
side of the road, paused at the
sound of Mark’s second and more
impatient knock, and said civilly—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you not the young folks my
friend John Avenel told me this
morning he expected to visit him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, please, Mr Dale,” said Mrs
Fairfield, dropping her curtsey. “You
remember me! and this is my dear
good man!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What! Mark the poet?” said
the curate of Lansmere, with a smile.
“Come to write squibs for the election?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Squibs, sir!” cried Mark indignantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Burns wrote squibs,” said the
curate mildly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mark made no answer, but again
knocked at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>This time, a man, whose face, even
seen by the starlight, was much
flushed, presented himself at the
threshold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr Morgan!” exclaimed the
curate, in benevolent alarm; “no
illness here, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cott! it is you, Mr Dale! Come
in, come in; I want a word with
you. But who the teuce are these
people?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir,” said Mark, pushing through
the doorway, “my name is Fairfield,
and my wife is Mr Avenel’s
daughter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Jane—and her baby too!
Cood—cood! Come in; but be quiet,
can’t you? Still, still—still as
death!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The party entered, the door closed;
the moon rose, and shone calmly on
the pale silent house, on the sleeping
flowers of the little garden, on the
old pollard with its hollow core. The
horse in the taxed-cart dozed, unheeded;
the light still at times flitted
across the upper windows. These
were the only signs of life, except
when a bat, now and then attracted
by the light that passed across the
windows, brushed against the panes,
and then, dipping downwards, struck
up against the nose of the slumbering
horse, and darted merrily after the
moth that fluttered round the raven’s
nest in the old pollard.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class='c014'>All that day Harley L’Estrange
had been more than usually mournful
and dejected. Indeed the return to
scenes associated with Nora’s presence
increased the gloom that had settled
on his mind since he had lost sight
and trace of her. Audley, in the
remorseful tenderness he felt for his
injured friend, had induced L’Estrange
towards evening to leave the
Park, and go into a district some
miles off, on pretence that he required
Harley’s aid there to canvass certain
important outvoters: the change of
scene might rouse him from his reveries.
Harley himself was glad to
escape from the guests at Lansmere.
He readily consented to go. He would
not return that night. The outvoters
lay remote and scattered—he might
be absent for a day or two. When
Harley was gone, Egerton himself
sank into deep thought. There was
rumour of some unexpected opposition.
His partisans were alarmed
and anxious. It was clear that the
Lansmere interest, if attacked, was
weaker than the Earl would believe;
Egerton might lose his election. If
so, what would become of him? How
support his wife, whose return to him
he always counted on, and whom it
would then become him at all hazards
to acknowledge? It was that day that
he had spoken to William Hazeldean
as to the family living. “Peace, at
least,” thought the ambitious man—“I
shall have peace!” And the
Squire had promised him the rectory
if needed; not without a secret pang,
for his Carry was already using her
conjugal influence in favour of her old
school friend’s husband, Mr Dale;
and the Squire thought Audley would
be but a poor country parson, and
Dale—if he would only grow a little
plumper than his curacy could permit
him to be—would be a parson in ten
thousand. But while Audley thus
prepared for the worst, he still brought
his energies to bear on the more brilliant
option; and sate with his committee,
looking into canvass-books,
and discussing the characters, politics,
and local interests of every
elector, until the night was wellnigh
gone. When he gained his room, the
shutters were unclosed, and he stood
a few moments at the window gazing
on the moon. At that sight, the
thought of Nora, lost and afar, stole
over him. The man, as we know,
had in his nature little of romance
and sentiment. Seldom was it his
wont to gaze upon moon or stars.
But whenever some whisper of romance
did soften his hard, strong
mind, or whenever moon or stars
did charm his gaze from earth, Nora’s
bright muse-like face—Nora’s sweet
loving eyes, were seen in moon and
star beam—Nora’s low tender voice,
heard in the whisper of that which
we call romance, and which is but the
sound of the mysterious poetry that
is ever in the air, could we but deign
to hear it! He turned with a sigh,
undressed, threw himself on his bed,
and extinguished his light. But the
light of the moon <em>would</em> fill the room.
It kept him awake for a little time;
he turned his face from the calm,
heavenly beam, resolutely towards
the dull blind wall, and fell asleep.
And, in the sleep, he was with Nora;—again
in the humble bridal-home.
Never in his dreams had she seemed
to him so distinct and life-like—her
eyes upturned to his—her hands
clasped together, and resting on his
shoulder, as had been her graceful
wont—her voice murmuring meekly,
“Has it, then, been my fault that we
parted?—forgive, forgive me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the sleeper imagined that he
answered, “Never part from me
again—never, never!” and that he
bent down to kiss the chaste lips
that so tenderly sought his own.
And suddenly he heard a knocking
sound, as of a hammer—regular, but
soft, low, subdued. Did you ever,
O reader, hear the sound of the
hammer on the lid of a coffin in a
house of woe,—when the undertaker’s
decorous hireling fears that
the living may hear how he parts
them from the dead? Such seemed
the sound to Audley—the dream
vanished abruptly. He woke, and
again heard the knock; it was
at his door. He sate up wistfully—the
moon was gone—it was morning.
“Who is there?” he cried
peevishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A low voice from without answered,
“Hush, it is I; dress quick; let
me see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Egerton recognised Lady Lansmere’s
voice. Alarmed and surprised,
he rose, dressed in haste, and went
to the door. Lady Lansmere was
standing without, extremely pale.
She put her finger to her lip and
beckoned him to follow her. He
obeyed mechanically. They entered
her dressing-room, a few doors from
his own chamber, and the Countess
closed the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then laying her slight firm hand
on his shoulder, she said in suppressed
and passionate excitement—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Mr Egerton, you must serve
me, and at once—Harley—Harley—save
my Harley—go to him—prevent
his coming back here—stay with him—give
up the election—it is but a
year or two lost in your life—you
will have other opportunities—make
that sacrifice to your friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Speak—what is the matter? I
can make no sacrifice too great for
Harley!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks—I was sure of it. Go
then, I say, at once to Harley; keep
him away from Lansmere on any
excuse you can invent, until you
can break the sad news to him—gently,
gently. Oh, how will he bear it—how
recover the shock? My boy,
my boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Calm yourself! Explain! Break
what news?—recover what shock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“True—you do not know—you
have not heard. Nora Avenel lies
yonder, in her father’s house—dead—dead!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Audley staggered back, clapping
his hand to his heart, and then dropping
on his knee as if bowed down by
the stroke of heaven.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My bride, my wife!” he muttered.
“Dead—it cannot be!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Lansmere was so startled at
this exclamation, so stunned by a
confession wholly unexpected, that
she remained unable to soothe—to explain,
and utterly unprepared for the
fierce agony that burst from the man
she had ever seen so dignified and
cold—when he sprang to his feet, and
all the sense of his eternal loss rushed
upon his heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>At length he crushed back his emotions,
and listened in apparent calm,
and in a silence broken but by quick
gasps for breath, to Lady Lansmere’s
account.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the guests in the house,
a female relation of Lady Lansmere’s,
had been taken suddenly ill
about an hour or two before;—the
house had been disturbed, the Countess
herself aroused, and Mr Morgan
summoned as the family medical
practitioner. From him she had
learned that Nora Avenel had returned
to her father’s house late on
the previous evening; had been seized
with brain fever, and died in a few
hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>Audley listened, and turned to the
door, still in silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Lansmere caught him by the
arm—“Where are you going? Ah,
can I now ask you to save my son
from the awful news, you yourself the
sufferer? And yet—yet—you know
his haste, his vehemence, if he learn
that you were his rival—her husband;
you whom he so trusted! What,
what would be the result?—I
tremble!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tremble not—I do not tremble!
Let me go—I will be back soon—and
then—(his lips writhed)—<em>then</em> we
will talk of Harley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Egerton went forth, stunned and
dizzy. Mechanically he took his way
across the park to John Avenel’s
house. He had been forced to enter
that house, formally, a day or two
before, in the course of his canvass;
and his worldly pride had received a
shock when the home, the birth, and
the manners of his bride’s parents had
been brought before him. He had
even said to himself, “And is it the
child of these persons that I, Audley
Egerton, must announce to the world
as wife!” Now, if she had been the
child of a beggar—nay, of a felon—<em>now</em>,
if he could but recall her to life,
how small and mean would all that
dreaded world have seemed to him!
Too late—too late! The dews were
glistening in the sun—the birds were
singing over head—life waking all
around him—and his own heart felt
like a charnel-house. Nothing but
death and the dead there—nothing!
He arrived at the door; it was open:
he called; no one answered: he walked
up the narrow stairs, undisturbed,
unseen; he came into the chamber of
death. At the opposite side of the
bed was seated John Avenel; but he
seemed in a heavy sleep. In fact,
paralysis had smitten him; but he
knew it not; neither did any one.
Who could heed the strong hearty
man in such a moment? Not even the
poor anxious wife! He had been left
there to guard the house, and watch
the dead—an unconscious man; numbed,
himself, by the invisible icy hand!
Audley stole to the bedside; he lifted
the coverlid thrown over the pale still
face. What passed within him, during
the minute he staid there, who shall
say? But when he left the room, and
slowly descended the stairs, he left
behind him love and youth, all the
sweet hopes and joys of the household
human life—for ever and ever!</p>

<p class='c008'>He returned to Lady Lansmere,
who awaited his coming with the
most nervous anxiety.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now,” said he drily, “I will go
to Harley, and I will prevent his returning
hither.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have seen the parents. Good
heavens! do they know of your marriage?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; to Harley I must own it
first. Meanwhile, silence!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silence!” echoed Lady Lansmere;
and her burning hand rested in
Audley’s, and Audley’s hand was as
ice.</p>

<p class='c008'>In another hour Egerton had left
the house, and before noon he was
with Harley.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is necessary now to explain the
absence of all the Avenel family, except
the poor stricken father.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nora had died in giving birth to a
child—died delirious. In her delirium
she had spoken of shame—of disgrace;
there was no holy nuptial ring on her
finger! Through all her grief, the first
thought of Mrs Avenel was to save
the good name of her lost daughter—the
unblemished honour of all the
living Avenels. No matron, long descended
from knights or kings, had
keener pride in name and character
than the poor, punctilious Calvinistic
trader’s wife. “Sorrow later, honour
now!” With hard dry eyes she
mused and mused, and made out her
plan. Jane Fairfield should take
away the infant at once, before the day
dawned, and nurse it with her own.
Mark should go with her, for Mrs
Avenel dreaded the indiscretion of his
wild grief. She would go with them
herself part of the way, in order to
command or reason them into guarded
silence. But they could not go back
to Hazeldean with another infant;
Jane must go where none knew her;
the two infants might pass as twins.
And Mrs Avenel, though naturally a
humane, kindly woman, and with a
mother’s heart to infants, looked with
almost a glad sternness at Jane’s puny
babe, and thought to herself, “All
difficulty will be over if there be only
<em>one</em>! Nora’s child could thus pass
throughout life for Jane’s!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately for the preservation of
the secret, the Avenels kept no servant—only
an occasional drudge, who
came a few hours in the day, and
went home to sleep. Mrs Avenel
could count on Mr Morgan’s silence
as to the true cause of Nora’s death.
And, Mr Dale, why should he reveal
the dishonour of a family? That
very day, or the next at farthest, she
could induce her husband to absent
himself lest he should blab out the
tale while his sorrow was greater
than his pride. She alone would
then stay in the house of death until
she could feel assured that all else were
hushed into prudence. Ay, she felt,
that with due precautions, the <em>name</em>
was still safe. And so she awed and
hurried Mark and his wife away, and
went with them in the covered cart—that
hid the faces of all three—leaving
for an hour or two the house
and the dead to her husband’s charge,
with many an admonition, to which
he nodded his head, and which he
did not hear! Do you think this
woman was unfeeling and inhuman?
Had Nora looked from heaven into
her mother’s heart, Nora would not
have thought so. A good name,
when the burial stone closes over
dust, is still a possession upon the
earth; on earth it is indeed our only
one! Better for our friends to guard
for us that treasure than to sit down
and weep over perishable clay. And
weep—Oh! stern mother, long years
were left to thee for weeping! No
tears shed for Nora made such deep
furrows on the cheeks as thine did!
Yet who ever saw them flow?</p>

<p class='c008'>Harley was in great surprise to
see Egerton; more surprised when
Egerton told him that he found he
was to be opposed—that he had no
chance of success at Lansmere, and
had, therefore, resolved to retire from
the contest. He wrote to the Earl to
that effect; but the Countess knew
the true cause, and hinted it to the
Earl; so that, as we saw at the commencement
of this history, Egerton’s
cause did not suffer when Captain
Dashmore appeared in the borough;
and, thanks to Mr Hazeldean’s exertions
and oratory, Audley came in by
two votes—the votes of John Avenel
and Mark Fairfield. For though the
former had been removed a little way
from the town, and by medical advice—and
though, on other matters,
the disease that had smitten him left
him docile as a child—yet he still
would hear how the Blues went on,
and would get out of bed to keep his
word; and even his wife said, “He
is right; better die of it than break
his promise!” The crowd gave way
as the broken man they had seen a
few days before so jovial and healthful
was brought up on a chair to the
poll, and said with his tremulous
quavering voice, “I’m a true Blue—Blue
for ever!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Elections are wondrous things!
No one who has not seen, can guess
how the zeal in them triumphs over
sickness, sorrow, the ordinary private
life of us!</p>

<p class='c008'>There was forwarded to Audley,
from Lansmere Park, Nora’s last
letter. The postman had left it there
an hour or two after he himself had
gone. The wedding-ring fell on the
ground, and rolled under his feet.
And those burning passionate reproaches—all
that anger of the
wounded dove—they explained to
him the mystery of her return—her
unjust suspicions—the cause of her
sudden death, which he still ascribed
to brain fever, brought on by excitement
and fatigue. For Nora did not
speak of the child about to be born;
she had not remembered it when she
wrote, or she would not have written.
On the receipt of this letter, Egerton
could not remain in the dull village
district—alone, too, with Harley. He
said, abruptly, that he must go to
London—prevailed on L’Estrange to
accompany him; and there, when he
heard from Lady Lansmere that the
funeral was over, he broke to Harley,
with lips as white as the dead, and
his hand pressed to his heart, on
which his hereditary disease was
fastening quick and fierce, the dread
truth that Nora was no more. The
effect upon the boy’s health and
spirits was even more crushing than
Audley could anticipate. He only
woke from grief to feel remorse.
“For,” said the noble Harley, “had
it not been for my mad passion—my
rash pursuit—would she ever have
left her safe asylum—ever even have
left her native town? And then—and
then—the struggle between her sense
of duty and her love to me! I see it
all—all! But for me, she were living
still!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no!” cried Egerton—his confession
now rushing to his lips.
“Believe me, she never loved you
as you think. Nay—nay—hear me!
Rather suppose that she loved another—fled
with him—was perhaps
married to him, and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold!” exclaimed Harley, with a
terrible burst of passion—“you kill
her twice to me, if you say that! I
can still feel that she lives—lives here,
in my heart—while I dream that she
loved me—or, at least, that no other
lip ever knew the kiss that was denied
to mine! But if you tell me to doubt
<em>that</em>;—you—you”——The boy’s anguish
was too great for his frame; he
fell suddenly back into Audley’s arms;
he had broken a blood-vessel. For
several days he was in great danger,
but his eyes were constantly fixed on
Audley’s, with wistful, intense gaze.
“Tell me,” he muttered, at the risk
of reopening the ruptured veins, and
of the instant loss of life—“tell me—you
did not mean <em>that</em>! Tell me you
have no cause to think she loved another—<em>was</em>
another’s!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, hush—no cause—none—none.
I meant but to comfort you, as
I thought—fool that I was—that is
all!” cried the miserable friend. And
from that hour Audley gave up the
idea of righting himself in his own
eyes, and submitted still to be the living
lie—he, the haughty gentleman!</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, while Harley was still very
weak and suffering, Mr Dale came to
London, and called on Egerton. The
curate, in promising secresy to Mr
Avenel, had made one condition, that
it should not be to the positive injury
of Nora’s living son. What if she
were married, after all? And would
it not be right, at least, to learn the
name of the child’s father? Some day
he might need a father. Mrs Avenel
was obliged to content herself with
these reservations. However, she implored
Mr Dale not to make inquiries.
What good could they do? If Nora
were married, her husband would
naturally, of his own accord, declare
himself; if seduced and forsaken, it
would but disgrace her memory (now
saved from stain) to discover the father
to a child of whose very existence the
world as yet knew nothing. These
arguments perplexed the good curate.
But Jane Fairfield had a sanguine
belief in her sister’s innocence; and all
her suspicions naturally pointed to
Lord L’Estrange. So, indeed, perhaps,
did Mrs Avenel’s, though she
never owned them. Of the correctness
of these suspicions Mr Dale was
fully convinced;—the young lord’s
admiration, Lady Lansmere’s fears,
had been too evident to one who had
often visited at the Park—Harley’s
abrupt departure just before Nora’s
return home—Egerton’s sudden resignation
of the borough before even
opposition was declared, in order to
rejoin his friend, the very day of
Nora’s death—all confirmed his ideas
that Harley was the betrayer or the
husband. Perhaps there might have
been a secret marriage—possibly
abroad—since Harley wanted some
years of his majority. He would, at
least, try to see and to sound Lord
L’Estrange. Prevented this interview
by Harley’s illness, the curate
resolved to ascertain how far he could
penetrate into the mystery by a conversation
with Egerton. There was
much in the grave repute which the
latter had acquired, and the singular
and pre-eminent character for truth
and honour with which it was accompanied,
that made the curate resolve
upon this step. Accordingly, he saw
Egerton, meaning only diplomatically
to extract from the new member for
Lansmere what might benefit the
family of the voters who had given
him his majority of two.</p>

<p class='c008'>He began by mentioning, as a
touching fact, how poor John Avenel,
bowed down by the loss of his child,
and the malady which had crippled
his limbs and enfeebled his mind, had
still risen from his bed to keep his
word. And Audley’s emotions seemed
to him so earnest and genuine, to show
so good a heart, that out by little and
little came more; first, his suspicions
that poor Nora had been betrayed;
then his hopes that there might have
been private marriage; and as Audley,
with his iron self-command,
showed just the proper degree of interest,
and no more, he went on, till
Audley knew that he had a child!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Inquire no further!” said the
man of the world. “Respect Mrs
Avenel’s feelings and wishes, I entreat
you; they are the right ones.
Leave the rest to me. In my position—I
mean as a resident of London—I
can quietly and easily ascertain more
than you could, and provoke no
scandal! If I could right this—this—poor—poor—(his
voice trembled)—right
the lost mother, or the living
child—sooner or later you will hear
from me; if not, bury this secret
where it now rests, in a grave which
slander has not reached. But the
child—give me the address where it
is to be found—in case I succeed in
finding the father, and touching his
heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Mr Egerton, may I not say
where you may find him—who he
is?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do not be angry; and, after all,
I cannot ask you to betray any confidence
which a friend may have
placed in you. I know what you
men of high honour are to each other—even
in sin. No, no—I beg pardon;
I leave all in your hands. I
shall hear from you, then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or, if not—why, then, believe
that all search is hopeless. My friend!
if you mean Lord L’Estrange, he is
innocent. I—I—I—(the voice faltered)—am
convinced of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The curate sighed, but made no
answer. “Oh, ye men of the world!”
thought he. He gave the address
which the member for Lansmere had
asked for, and went his way, and
never heard again from Audley Egerton.
He was convinced that the man
who had showed such deep feeling
had failed in his appeal to Harley’s
conscience, or had judged it best to
leave Nora’s name in peace, and her
child to her own relations and the care
of heaven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harley L’Estrange, scarcely yet recovered,
hastened to join our armies
on the Continent, and seek the Death
which, like its half-brother, rarely
comes when we call it.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as Harley was gone, Egerton
went to the village to which Mr
Dale had directed him, to seek for
Nora’s child. But here he was led
into a mistake which materially affected
the tenor of his own life, and
Leonard’s future destinies. Mrs Fairfield
had been naturally ordered by
her mother to take another name in
the village to which she had gone
with the two infants, so that her connexion
with the Avenel family might
not be traced, to the provocation of
inquiry and gossip. The grief and excitement
through which she had gone
dried the source of nutriment in her
breast. She put Nora’s child out to
nurse at the house of a small farmer,
at a little distance from the village,
and moved from her first lodging to
be nearer to the infant. Her own
child was so sickly and ailing, that
she could not bear to intrust it to the
care of another. She tried to bring
it up by hand; and the poor child
soon pined away and died. She and
Mark could not endure the sight of
their baby’s grave; they hastened to
return to Hazeldean, and took Leonard
with them. From that time
Leonard passed for the son they
had lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Egerton arrived at the village,
and inquired for the person whose
address had been given to him, he
was referred to the cottage in which
she had last lodged, and was told
that she had been gone some days—the
day after her child was buried.
Her child buried! Egerton staid to
inquire no more; thus he heard nothing
of the infant that had been put out to
nurse. He walked slowly into the
churchyard, and stood for some
minutes gazing on the small new
mound; then, pressing his hand on the
heart to which all emotion had been
forbidden, he re-entered his chaise and
returned to London. The sole reason
for acknowledging his marriage seemed
to him now removed. Nora’s name
had escaped reproach. Even had his
painful position with regard to Harley
not constrained him to preserve his
secret, there was every motive to the
World’s wise and haughty son not to
acknowledge a derogatory and foolish
marriage, now that none lived whom
concealment could wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>Audley mechanically resumed his
former life,—sought to resettle his
thoughts on the grand objects of ambitious
men. His poverty still pressed
on him; his pecuniary debt to
Harley stung and galled his peculiar
sense of honour. He saw no way to
clear his estates, to repay his friend,
but by some rich alliance. Dead to
love, he faced this prospect first with
repugnance, then with apathetic indifference.
Levy, of whose treachery
towards himself and Nora he was unaware,
still held over him the power
that the money-lender never loses
over the man that has owed, owes, or
may owe again. Levy was ever
urging him to propose to the rich
Miss Leslie;—Lady Lansmere, willing
to atone, as she thought, for his
domestic loss, urged the same;—Harley,
influenced by his mother, wrote
from the Continent to the same effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Manage it as you will,” at last
said Egerton to Levy, “so that I am
not a wife’s pensioner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Propose for me if you will,” he
said to Lady Lansmere—“I cannot
woo—I cannot talk of love.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow or other the marriage,
with all its rich advantages to the
ruined gentleman, was thus made up.
And Egerton, as we have seen, was
the polite and dignified husband before
the world—married to a woman
who adored him. It is the common
fate of men like him to be loved too
well!</p>

<p class='c008'>On her deathbed his heart was
touched by his wife’s melancholy reproach—“Nothing
I could do has
ever made you love me!” “It is
true,” answered Audley, with tears in
his voice and eyes—“Nature gave
me but a small fund of what women
like you call ‘love,’ and I lavished it
all away.” And he then told her,
though with reserve, some portion of
his former history;—and that soothed
her; for when she saw that he <em>had</em>
loved, and <em>could</em> grieve, she caught a
glimpse of the human heart she had
not seen before. She died, forgiving
him, and blessing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Audley’s spirits were much affected
by this new loss. He inly resolved
never to marry again. He had a
vague thought at first of retrenching
his expenditure, and making young
Randal Leslie his heir. But when he
first saw the clever Eton boy, his feelings
did not warm to him, though his
intellect appreciated Randal’s quick
keen talents. He contented himself
with resolving to push the boy;—to
do what was merely just to the distant
kinsman of his late wife. Always
careless and lavish in money matters,
generous and princely, not from the
delight of serving others, but from a
<em>grand Seigneur’s</em> sentiment of what
was due to himself and his station,
Audley had a mournful excuse for the
lordly waste of the large fortune at
his control. The morbid functions of
the heart had become organic disease.
True, he might live many years, and
die at last of some other complaint in
the course of nature; but the progress
of the disease would quicken with all
emotional excitement; he might die
suddenly—any day—in the very
prime, and, seemingly, in the full
vigour, of his life. And the only physician
in whom he confided what he
wished to keep concealed from the
world, (for ambitious men would fain
be thought immortal,) told him frankly
that it was improbable that, with the
wear and tear of political strife and
action, he could advance far into
middle age. Therefore, no son of his
succeeding—his nearest relations all
wealthy—Egerton resigned himself to
his constitutional disdain of money;
he could look into no affairs, provided
the balance in his banker’s hands were
such as became the munificent commoner.
All else he left to his steward
and to Levy. Levy grew rapidly
rich—very, very rich—and the
steward thrived.</p>

<p class='c008'>The usurer continued to possess a
determined hold over the imperious
great man. He knew Audley’s secret;
he could reveal that secret to
Harley. And the one soft and tender
side of the statesman’s nature—the
sole part of him not dipped in the
ninefold Styx of practical prosaic life,
which so renders man invulnerable to
affection—was his remorseful love for
the school friend whom he still deceived.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here then you have the key to the
locked chambers of Audley Egerton’s
character, the fortified castle of his
mind. The envied minister—the joyless
man—the oracle on the economics
of an empire—the prodigal in a
usurer’s hands—the august, high-crested
gentleman, to whom princes would
refer for the casuistry of honour—the
culprit trembling lest the friend he
best loved on earth should detect his
lie! Wrap thyself in the decent veil
that the Arts or the Graces weave for
thee, O Human Nature! It is only
the statue of marble whose nakedness
the eye can behold without shame
and offence!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Of the narrative just placed before
the reader, it is clear that Leonard
could gather only desultory fragments.
He could but see that his ill-fated
mother had been united to a man she
had loved with surpassing tenderness;
had been led to suspect that the
marriage was fraudulent; had gone
abroad in despair, returned repentant
and hopeful; had gleaned some intelligence
that her lover was about to be
married to another, and there the
manuscript closed with the blisters
left on the page by agonising tears.
The mournful end of Nora—her
lonely return to die under the roof of
her parents—this he had learned before
from the narrative of Dr Morgan.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even the name of her supposed
husband was not revealed. Of him
Leonard could form no conjecture,
except that he was evidently of higher
rank than Nora. Harley L’Estrange
seemed clearly indicated in the early
boy-lover. If so, he must know all
that was left dark to Leonard, and to
him Leonard resolved to confide the
MS. With this resolution he left the
cottage, resolving to return and attend
the funeral obsequies of his departed
friend. Mrs Goodyer willingly permitted
him to take away the papers
she had lent to him, and added to them
the packet which had been addressed
to Mrs Bertram from the Continent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Musing in anxious gloom over the
record he had read, Leonard entered
London on foot, and bent his way
towards Harley’s hotel; when, just as
he had crossed into Bond Street, a
gentleman in company with Baron
Levy, and who seemed, by the flush
on his brow and the sullen tone of
his voice, to have had rather an
irritating colloquy with the fashionable
usurer, suddenly caught sight
of Leonard, and, abruptly quitting
Levy, seized the young man by the
arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Excuse me, sir,” said the gentleman,
looking hard into Leonard’s
face; “but unless these sharp eyes
of mine are mistaken, which they seldom
are, I see a nephew whom, perhaps,
I behaved to rather too harshly,
but who still has no right to forget
Richard Avenel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear uncle,” exclaimed Leonard,
“this is indeed a joyful surprise;
at a time, too, when I needed
joy! No; I have never forgotten
your kindness, and always regretted
our estrangement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is well said; give us your
fist again. Let me look at you—quite
the gentleman I declare!—still
so good-looking too. We Avenels
always were. Good bye, Baron
Levy. Need not wait for me; I am
not going to run away. I shall see
you again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But,” whispered Levy, who had
followed Avenel across the street,
and eyed Leonard with a quick curious
searching glance—“but it must
be as I say with regard to the borough;
or (to be plain) you must cash the
bills on the day they are due.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, sir—very well. So
you think to put the screw upon me, as
if I were a poor ten-pound householder.
I understand—my money or my
borough?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exactly so,” said the Baron,
with a soft smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You shall hear from me—you
shall hear from me. (Aside, as Levy
strolled away)—D——d tarnation
rascal!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dick Avenel then linked his arm in
his nephew’s, and strove for some
minutes to forget his own troubles,
in the indulgence of that curiosity in
the affairs of another which was natural
to him, and, in this instance, increased
by the real affection which he
had felt for Leonard. But still his
curiosity remained unsatisfied; for
long before Leonard could overcome
his habitual reluctance to speak of his
success in letters, Dick’s mind wandered
back to his rival at Screwstown,
and the curse of “over-competition”—to
the bills which Levy had discounted,
in order to enable Dick to
meet the crushing force of a capitalist
larger than himself—and the “tarnation
rascal” who now wished to obtain
two seats at Lansmere, one for Randal
Leslie, one for a rich Nabob whom
Levy had just caught as a client;
and Dick, though willing to aid Leslie,
had a mind to the other seat for
himself. Therefore Dick soon broke
in upon the hesitating confessions of
Leonard, with exclamations far from
pertinent to the subject, and rather
for the sake of venting his own griefs
and resentment than with any idea
that the sympathy or advice of his
nephew could serve him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well,” said Dick, “another
time for your history. I see you
have thrived, and that is enough for
the present. Very odd; but just now
I can only think of myself. I’m in a
regular fix, sir. Screwstown is not
the respectable Screwstown that you
remember it—all demoralised and
turned topsy-turvy by a demoniacal
monster capitalist, with steam-engines
that might bring the falls of Niagara
into your back parlour, sir! And,
as if that was not enough to destroy
and drive into almighty shivers a
decent fair-play Britisher like myself,
I hear he is just in treaty for some
patent infernal invention that will
make his engines do twice as much
work with half as many hands!
That’s the way those unfeeling ruffians
increase our poor-rates! But
I’ll get up a riot against him—I will!
Don’t talk to me of the law! What the
devil is the good of the law if it don’t
protect a man’s industry—a <em>liberal</em>
man, too, like me!” Here Dick
burst into a storm of vituperation
against the rotten old country in
general, and the monster capitalist of
Screwstown in particular.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leonard started; for Dick now
named, in that monster capitalist, the
very person who was in treaty for
Leonard’s own mechanical improvement
on the steam-engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop, uncle—stop! Why, then, if
this man were to buy the contrivance
you speak of, it would injure
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Injure me, sir! I should be a
bankrupt—that is, if it succeeded;
but I daresay it is all a humbug.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, it <em>will</em> succeed—I’ll answer
for that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You! You have seen it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I invented it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dick hastily withdrew his arm from
Leonard’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Serpent’s tooth!” he said, falteringly,
“so it is you, whom I warmed
at my hearth, who are to ruin Richard
Avenel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—but to save him! Come
into the city and look at my model.
If you like it, the patent shall be
yours!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cab—cab—cab,” cried Dick
Avenel, stopping a “Hansom;”
“jump in, Leonard—jump in. I’ll
buy your patent—that is, if it is worth
a straw; and as for payment—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Payment! Don’t talk of that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I won’t,” said Dick, mildly;
“for ’tis not the topic of conversation
I should choose myself, just at
present. And as for that black-whiskered
alligator, the Baron, let me
first get out of those rambustious unchristian
filbert-shaped claws of his,
and then—But jump in—jump in—and
tell the man where to drive!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A very brief inspection of Leonard’s
invention sufficed to show Richard
Avenel how invaluable it would be
to him. Armed with a patent, of
which the certain effects in the increase
of power and diminution of
labour were obvious to any practical
man, Avenel felt that he should
have no difficulty in obtaining such
advances of money as he required,
whether to alter his engines, meet
the bills discounted by Levy, or carry
on the war with the monster capitalist.
It might be necessary to admit
into partnership some other monster
capitalist—What then? Any partner
better than Levy. A bright idea
struck him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I can just terrify and whop
that infernal intruder on my own
ground, for a few months, he may
offer, himself, to enter into partnership—make
the two concerns a joint-stock
friendly combination, and then
we shall flog the world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His gratitude to Leonard became
so lively that Dick offered to bring
his nephew in for Lansmere instead
of himself; and when Leonard declined
the offer, exclaimed, “Well,
then, any friend of yours; you have
only to say the word at the last hour,
for I am sure of both seats. I’m all
for Reform against those high and
mighty right honourable boroughmongers;
and what with loans and mortgages
on the small householders, and
a long course of “free and easies,”
with the independent Freemen, I
carry the town of Lansmere in my
breeches pocket.” Dick then, appointing
an interview with Leonard
at his lawyer’s, to settle the transfer
of the invention, upon terms which he
declared “should be honourable to
both parties,” hurried off, to search
amongst his friends in the city for
some monster capitalist, who might be
induced to extricate him from the
jaws of Levy, and the engines of his
rival at Screwstown. “Mullins is
the man, if I can but catch him,” said
Dick. “You have heard of Mullins?—A
wonderful great man; you should
see his nails; he never cuts them!
Three millions, at least, he has scraped
together with those nails of his, sir.
And in this rotten old country, a
man must have nails a yard long to
fight with a devil like Levy! Good
bye—good <em>bye</em>—<span class='fss'>GOOD</span> bye, my <span class='fss'>DEAR</span>
nephew!”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Harley L’Estrange was seated alone
in his apartments. He had just put
down a volume of some favourite
classic author, and he was resting his
hand firmly clenched upon the book.
Ever since Harley’s return to England,
there had been a perceptible
change in the expression of his countenance,
even in the very bearing and
attitudes of his elastic youthful figure.
But this change had been more marked
since that last interview with Helen
which has been recorded. There was
a compressed resolute firmness in the
lips—a decided character in the brow.
To the indolent careless grace of his
movements had succeeded a certain
indescribable energy, as quiet and
self-collected as that which distinguished
the determined air of Audley
Egerton himself. In fact, if you could
have looked into his heart, you would
have seen that Harley was, for the
first time, making a strong effort over
his passions and his humours; that
the whole man was nerving himself
to a sense of duty. “No,” he muttered—“no—I
will think only of
Helen; I will think only of real life!
And what (were I not engaged to
another) would that dark-eyed Italian
girl be to me?—What a mere
fool’s fancy is this! I love again—I
who, through all the fair spring of
my life, have clung with such faith to
a memory and a grave!  Come,
come, come, Harley L’Estrange, act
thy part as man amongst men, at
last! Accept regard; dream no more
of passion. Abandon false ideals.
Thou art no poet—why deem that life
itself can be a poem?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The door opened, and the Austrian
Prince, whom Harley had interested
in the cause of Violante’s father, entered
with the familiar step of a
friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you discovered those documents
yet?” said the Prince. “I
must now return to Vienna within a
few days. And unless you can arm
me with some tangible proof of Peschiera’s
ancient treachery, or some
more unanswerable excuse for his
noble kinsman, I fear that there is no
other hope for the exile’s recall to
his country than what lies in the
hateful option of giving his daughter
to his perfidious foe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alas!” said Harley, “as yet, all
researches have been in vain; and I
know not what other steps to take,
without arousing Peschiera’s vigilance,
and setting his crafty brains at work
to counteract us. My poor friend,
then, must rest contented with exile.
To give Violante to the Count were
dishonour. But I shall soon be married;
soon have a home, not quite
unworthy of their due rank, to offer
both to father and to child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would the future Lady L’Estrange
feel no jealousy of a guest so
fair as you tell me this young signorina
is? And would you be in no
danger yourself, my poor friend?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pooh!” said Harley, colouring.
“My fair guest would have <em>two</em>
fathers; that is all. Pray do not
jest on a thing so grave as honour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the door opened, and Leonard
appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Welcome,” cried Harley, pleased
to be no longer alone under the
Prince’s penetrating eye—“welcome.
This is the noble friend who shares
our interest for Riccabocca, and who
could serve him so well, if we could
but discover the document of which
I have spoken to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is here,” said Leonard simply;
“may it be all that you require!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harley eagerly grasped at the
packet, which had been sent from
Italy to the supposed Mrs Bertram,
and, leaning his face on his hand,
rapidly hurried through the contents.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurrah!” he cried at last, with
his face lighted up, and a boyish toss
of his right hand. “Look, look,
Prince, here are Peschiera’s own
letters to his kinsman’s wife; his
avowal of what he calls his ‘patriotic
designs;’ his entreaties to her to
induce her husband to share them.
Look, look, how he wields his influence
over the woman he had once
wooed; look how artfully he combats
her objections; see how reluctant our
friend was to stir, till wife and kinsman
both united to urge him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is enough,—quite enough,” exclaimed
the Prince, looking at the
passages in Peschiera’s letters which
Harley pointed out to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, it is not enough,” shouted
Harley as he continued to read the
letters with his rapid sparkling eyes.
“More still! O villain, doubly
damned! Here, after our friend’s
flight, here, is his avowal of guilty
passion; here he swears that he had
intrigued to ruin his benefactor, in
order to pollute the home that had
sheltered him. Ah! see how she
answers; thank Heaven her own eyes
were opened at last, and she scorned
him before she died. She was innocent!
I said so. Violante’s mother
was pure. Poor lady, this moves
me! Has your Emperor the heart
of a man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know enough of our Emperor,”
answered the Prince warmly, “to
know that, the moment these papers
reach him, Peschiera is ruined, and
your friend is restored to his honours.
You will live to see the daughter, to
whom you would have given a child’s
place at your hearth, the wealthiest
heiress of Italy—the bride of some
noble lover, with rank only below the
supremacy of kings!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” said Harley, in a sharp
accent, and turning very pale—“ah,
I shall not see her that! I shall never
visit Italy again!—never see her
more—never, after she has once
quitted this climate of cold iron
cares and formal duties—never,
never!” He turned his head for a
moment, and then came with quick
step to Leonard. “But you, O
happy poet! No ideal can ever be
lost to you. You are independent of
real life. Would I were a poet!”
He smiled sadly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You would not say so, perhaps,
my dear lord,” answered Leonard
with equal sadness, “if you knew
how little what you call ‘the ideal’
replaces to a poet the loss of one
affection in the genial human world.
Independent of real life! Alas! no.
And I have here the confessions of a
true poet-soul, which I will entreat
you to read at leisure; and when you
have read, answer if you would still
be a poet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took forth Nora’s MSS. as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Place them yonder, in my <i><span lang="fr">secrétaire</span></i>,
Leonard; I will read them
later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do so, and with heed; for to me
there is much here that involves my
own life—much that is still a mystery,
and which I think you can unravel!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I!” exclaimed Harley; and he
was moving towards the <i><span lang="fr">secrétaire</span></i>,
in a drawer of which Leonard had
carefully deposited the papers, when
once more, but this time violently,
the door was thrown open, and Giacomo
rushed into the room, accompanied
by Lady Lansmere.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my lord, my lord!” cried
Giacomo, in Italian, “the signorina!
the signorina!—Violante!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What of her? Mother, mother!
what of her? Speak, speak!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She has gone—left our house!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Left! No, no!” cried Giacomo,
“She must have been deceived or
forced away. The Count! the Count!
Oh, my good lord, save her, as you
once saved her father!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold!” cried Harley. “Give
me your arm, mother.  A <em>second</em>
such blow in life is beyond the
strength of man—at least of mine.
So, so!—I am better now! Thank
you, mother. Stand back, all of you—give
me air. So the Count has
triumphed, and Violante has fled
with him! Explain all—I can bear
it!”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE EARL OF DERBY’S APPEAL TO THE COUNTRY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When we addressed our readers,
in the month of June last,<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> in a very
earnest, and perhaps a somewhat apprehensive
spirit, we declared that we
did so “on the eve of a tremendous
conflict, the results of which, in our
deliberately formed opinion, shared by
every thinking and experienced politician
in the kingdom, affect the welfare
of the Empire to an extent almost
unprecedented, and also, at present,
utterly incalculable.” That conflict
has now taken place, or rather it is
yet—while we are writing, very far
on in this memorable month of July
(the 24th inst.)—not quite over. It
has been, indeed, a signal conflict:
but between whom? And what is
the issue? Has there been a victory,
and consequently a defeat?
Is it the Earl of Derby, sitting dismayed
in his cabinet, from whose lips
these sad words are at this moment
falling, as he surveys the results of
the general election of 1852, on which
he had staked so much?—or is it his
rival and opponent? But <em>who is he</em>?—or
is his name legion? Is it Lord
John Russell?—or Sir James Graham?—or
the Duke of Newcastle?—or
Lord Palmerston?—or, dropping for
a moment to the <em>dii minores</em>, is it—Mr
Cobden?</p>

<p class='c008'>One fact is certain, that the Earl of
Derby, on the 1st of July 1852, upon
which day the writs were issued for a
new election, deliberately gave battle
to them all; having four months previously
declared that he would do so.
And on the occasion of making that
declaration, he furthermore declared,
in terms which no one could mistake,
that he intended to do battle for the
<em>Constitution in Church and State</em>—for
the Protestant Constitution; and
against those who were secretly or
openly advancing to assail its integrity,
under the baleful flag of <span class='sc'>Democracy</span>
and <span class='sc'>Popery</span>. He and his advisers
had been calm and quicksighted
enough to see that such was the true
nature of the great electoral struggle
ordained to take place in the month
of July 1852; and they had also sufficient
sagacity and resolution to foresee
and defeat the cunning and desperate
attempts which would be made by
their opponents, to disguise the true
nature and real objects of the contest,
and shift the scene of it to a disadvantageous
and deceptive locality.
Those, indeed, who made this attempt,
were wise in their generation, and did
the very best thing that the nature
of things admitted. Conscious of
occupying a discreditable and desperate
position, through their own
imbecility and recklessness, the only
chance of regaining lost ground, and
making a tolerated appearance before
the country, lay in attempting to
enlist popular sympathies; and the
felicitous device was, to persuade the
millions that their bread was in danger;—but
this was to be done, if at all
successfully, so very suddenly, that
the falsehood should not be found out
before it had gained its object. The
Earl of Derby was to be exhibited
before women and children as a vampyre,
but only for a moment, lest the
false colours should dissolve away
while they were being looked at, and
a wise and benevolent statesman appear
in his true figure and colours.
Hence the convulsive effort that was
made, the moment it was announced
that his gracious Mistress had summoned
him in a critical emergency to
her counsels, to precipitate him into
a contest before he had had a moment’s
time to survey his new position,
to summon his advisers about
him—to tell friends from foes—and
see what were the precise objects
which they had to keep in view.
“If,” said they, “Lord Derby be
allowed to go to the country at his
own time, and in his own way, the
country will welcome him as a deliverer
from mischievous misrule. Let
us, therefore, force him to select <em>our</em>
time, and <em>our</em> place, for fighting the
battle. If we hesitate, we are lost;
for he is strong and skilful, and the
country acute and honest.” In vain
the Earl said to his eager opponents,
“By your leave, gentlemen; for a
moment, by your leave. What is the
meaning of all this feverish fidget?
What are you afraid of?” “That
you will take away the people’s bread;
reverse a wise and beneficent policy;
and not only bid the sun of commercial
prosperity stand still, but go back,
and so plunge us all into confusion
and despair.” “I assure you,” quoth
the Earl, “I am not going to attempt
<em>any</em> of these things. I love the people
as much as yourselves, and, with you,
am one of them. My interests, like
your own, are identical with theirs: I
wish only to secure the safety of our
institutions, the common interests of
the Queen and the people, against
certain perils which I see distinctly,
though you may not. And as to the
corn question, in which you would tie
up, and hide, and crush all others, I
will have none of it. I have opinions
of my own on the subject of corn laws,
thinking it would be infinitely to the
benefit of the community if I could at
once derive a revenue for it from
foreigners, and enable our own corn-growers
to supply us with bread at a
reasonable price, and foster and stimulate
the energies of producers, and
provide a safe, quick-paying home-market
for them: thus protecting the
interests of both the great classes of
the community—producers and consumers.
If, however, your long-continued
and systematic agitation
and misrepresentations have succeeded
in persuading the masses of
society that my own views on that
subject are at variance with theirs, and
that theirs they are resolved shall prevail,
be it so; I will do all I can, less
than which I should desert my duty in
doing;—I will take care to submit that
particular question, in order to dissipate
all doubt, to the deliberate
decision of the country; and whatever
that decision may be, I will
cordially carry it out. But do you
seriously suppose that this question
is the only one by which I must
stand or fall?—the only one for
which the Queen called me to her
counsels? O no, gentlemen. Whichever
way the pleasure of the country
may lie upon this question, it is but
one, and that a subordinate one, of
several—nay, of many; it is but one,
and a subordinate interest among
several intrusted to my consideration
and my keeping. Suppose the corn
question totally set aside, and at
rest, and yourselves called to advise
the Sovereign, and carry on the government
of the country, <em>what would
you do, then</em>? You may pause; but
I know well what you would do.
Judging from your own repeated declarations,
you would, under the pretence
of liberalising our institutions,
intrust power to incompetent hands,
to be used only for the furtherance of
your own selfish purposes; they would
nominally, and you as demagogues
practically,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> be the depositaries of
power. Your avowed principles are
inconsistent with the maintenance of
our national independence; of the
connection between Church and State;
of the Protestant character of our institutions:
the Queen’s throne would
be shaken, and her crown quiver upon
her sacred brow, if you were intrusted
with the power for which you are so
anxious. I see distinctly before me
the crimsoned darkness of anarchy,
and through it the fabric of a republic
crumbling under a military despotism.
Now, gentlemen, I fear God and
honour the Queen; I am heart and
soul a Protestant; I am satisfied with
our institutions, civil and religious,
and believe that so are the people;
but let them speak out for themselves
on all these subjects, which I will submit
to them with deliberate distinctness,
despising your efforts to misrepresent
my objects and principles,
and await the decision with composure.”
“Well, but, my Lord, how
is this? Be so good as to tell us
in detail what you are going to do if
you should be continued in power; do
not set us running about in search of
shadows; do not amuse us with a
series of dissolving views; give us
something visible and tangible, in
order that we may deal with it in our
own way before the people.” “That
is, in order that you may misrepresent
it. No, my friends: you would
have me do exactly what I will
not do. It was by your own voluntary
act that I am where I am.
You should have considered consequences.
I did, and have formed my
purposes, and organised my plans.
My character and principles are before
the country, so are those of my colleagues.
These principles I will reassert
as emphatically as you please;
and I pledge myself to carry them out
in practice, if I have the opportunity.”
“But you will delude the country:
you will set them scampering in
every direction after will-o’-the-wisps,
while you and your myrmidons are
quietly stealing their bread, and forging
chains and dungeons for them.”
“Well, gentlemen, tell the country
as much: see whether they will believe
you. It is a fair question between
us. You say that yourselves,
and your doings are thoroughly well
known to them. Well, if that be so,
go and prosper with the constituencies,
for they will give you their confidence
if they think that you deserve it.
But observe, my good friends: if, thus
knowing you and your doings, <em>those
constituencies should decide against
you</em>, and in favour of me, my friends,
and our principles, even though I expressly
withhold a distinct declaration
of the way in which I purpose to act
upon them, what will you <em>then</em> say?
That those whom they knew they
reject, and have chosen others?”
It is an ugly dilemma! “But, my
Lord, you impute to us principles
and purposes which we repudiate:
we are <em>not</em> wolves in sheep’s clothing;
we are good, honest folk, the
best friends the people ever had—in
fact, their true, as you their false
friends.” “Well, gentlemen, what is
easier than to tell them so? You are
only losing time yourselves, and making
me lose precious time myself; for
all our hands are full, having the
Queen’s business to do in every quarter
of the globe. Good morning, my
friends, away to the constituencies.”
On this, one may conceive that the
colloquy ended, and the people’s imaginary
deputation withdrew, with
flushed faces, anxious brows, and disconcerted
looks, to their council-chamber
in Chesham Place. After a
troubled silence, one lean flippant fellow
among them possibly rose up, with
his arms stuck a-kimbo, and said—“Lord
Derby shall dissolve <em>instanter</em>:
we will kick his people out of the
House of Commons the very first day
we meet, and so force him to dissolve;
and I will bring out our trusty fellows
of the League, subscribe a hundred
thousand pounds, and in one month’s
time annihilate the crazy Cabinet, and
then there is an end of him!” But
these wild counsels did not altogether
prevail. The more steadily that matters
were looked at by long-headed
people, the more embarrassing was
found the position which had been
occupied. If the Earl of Derby should
succeed in presenting himself to the
people in his own way, and if they
should think fit to say, “We will have
no return to protective duties, but we
feel that there is a great derangement
of financial affairs which we believe
you capable of rectifying; and, above
all, we believe you a man of honour,
and agree with you as to the existence
of a dangerous conspiracy between
Popery and Democracy:” where
would then be those who had themselves
driven him to appeal to the
country? And as time wore on, it
saw Faction baffled and crushed, and
the new Ministers developing extraordinary
aptitude for business; exhibiting
uniform tact, temper, and firmness;
overcoming obstacle after obstacle,
formerly deemed insuperable;
winning majorities in division after
division, forced on them by their opponents;
while no amount of newspaper
stimulus could succeed in flurrying
the spirits of the country into
distrust or alarm. Not an opportunity
was lost in either House of Parliament
for gibing, taunting, misrepresenting,
sedulously echoed by the
Radical press out of doors, both metropolitan
and provincial. In four
months’ time, a skilfully-slandered
Ministry succeeded in conducting to a
satisfactory conclusion such a splendid
amount of legislation as will ever
render those four months memorable;
and at the close of that eventful
period, the Earl of Derby saw that
the proper moment for appealing to
the country had at length arrived:
at the voice of the Queen, her Parliament
dissolved away; and her people
were free to choose another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now had arrived indeed the tug
of war. Now was to be seen the fruit
of those seeds which all parties had
been sowing during the interval, with
a view to propitiating the people.
Those seeds had been scattered by
many hands, and were of various
kinds. A large proportion of that seed
consisted solely of <em>distrust of Lord
Derby</em>, because he <em>was</em> Lord Derby,
without principles or a policy; and
this seed was deemed the most attractive
and hopeful of any, by its
venerable and volatile sower, who
scattered it freely everywhere, watching
its growth with deep solicitude, for
he had laid out all the little he had left,
of political capital, in order to purchase
that seed. Said he to himself, with
sometimes a sigh, and sometimes a
smile, this will grow up, if at all,
flexible and chameleon-hued, according
to the condition of the political
atmosphere; and the vast extent to
which it is sown must, at all events,
show the spirit and resources of the
sower, and keep that personage
prominently before the public eye.
Another class of seeds had fallen from
a desponding and anxious sower, who
had been deposed by former followers
and supporters from a proud position,
and accused of having rendered necessary
the sowing of any seed at
all, at that particular conjuncture.
He moved tremulously along, scattering
his little seed, the growth of
which, he evidently hoped, might be
suitable for all purposes, and alarm
no one prematurely. He was rudely
jostled, however, by surly impudent
fellows, who furiously stamped on
what he had sown, and flung down
thickly large crimson-coloured seed,
which should by and by choke and
overpower the other by its baleful
and glaring crop. A few timid hands
scattered seeds stealthily, those of
parasitical plants, following in the
wake of a burly sower in scarlet, full
of deceit and insolence, dropping, as
he went, dark and deadly seed, heedless
of the alarm, the scorn, and the
hatred which he by turns provoked.
That seed was destined, in the sower’s
expectation, to produce ere long a
forest, overshadowing the land, with
all manner of obscene birds lodging
in its gloomy branches.</p>

<p class='c008'>To drop metaphor, however, the
appeal to the constituencies was undoubtedly
made under circumstances
calculated to occasion much anxiety
to the Queen’s Ministers, under whose
auspices that appeal was made. They
were in a great minority in the House
of Commons, and had been thrown
into that minority by reason of their
having been opposed to a measure
which, by whatever means, had
brought popularity to their opponents,
the majority. The latter had astutely
identified themselves with the most
palatable topic that can ever be urged
to the masses of the community—cheap
food, without reference to all
those deep and extensive political
arrangements, necessarily involved in
the discussion concerning the import
of foreign corn. Mr Cobden, for instance,
was aware of being a mere
cipher, disconnected with that question,
the agitation of which had alone
given him political importance, and
an independent fortune, securing him
leisure for all kinds of mischief; and
it was his interest, and that of all those
who were, with him, opposed to the
Government, to interweave that popular
topic with all other political topics,
giving them, and those urging them,
the hue of its popularity. Thus was
the constituency carefully familiarised
with a contrast between the friends
of free and fettered trade, with all
their respective advantages and disadvantages,
and the applause or
odium which either entailed. A
second source of anxiety to the well-wishers
of the Government, and unquestionably
a great one, was that
Government’s steady adherence to the
expressed determination of its chief,
on first assuming the reins of power,
that he would indicate only the general
<span class='fss'>PRINCIPLES</span> on which his policy was
founded, reserving all measures and
details, till the period when he should
be able to carry his plans and measures
into effect.  This was a severe
test to be borne by any class whatever
of aspirants to popular confidence and
favour. It was saying, “We stand
on character and principle; if you
distrust either, withhold your support.”
And this furnished such endless
topics of effective ridicule and invective
to the opponents of the Government,
as required no small amount of
moral courage in its supporters to
encounter. These topics were used
with systematic energy by a bitterly
hostile press for several months previously
to, as well as during, the
momentous contest with which we
are dealing; and it were idle to disguise
that these efforts were made
with great ability, and a very great
measure of success.  When, therefore,
the struggle commenced, we
ourselves said, It is a very critical
one, entered upon under circumstances
<em>most unfavourable to the
Government</em>: and if, in spite of those
immense disadvantages, the Government
should be victorious, it will be
a triumph indeed, and calculated to
secure them both strength and permanence.
A calm observer, however,
of the position of parties and the course
of events, could not fail to detect, on
the other hand, certain disturbing
forces inevitably affecting the tactics
of the opponents of Ministers. The
rashness of Lord John Russell in resigning
the Government as he did;
immediately recommending his gracious
Mistress to summon Lord Derby
to her counsels; and, instantly afterwards,
suddenly repenting of what he
had done, and, stung by the keen
reproaches of his supporters, organising
an opposition to Lord Derby,
simply because he had obeyed the
royal command—alienated from him a
great amount of that secret support
on which he had so long been borne
buoyant, and averted from him the
countenance of men, though professing
Liberal principles, yet characterised by
independence and moderation.  To
attempt a coalition with such a man
as Mr Cobden, and at the particular
moment selected for the experiment,
was one of the maddest tricks of
modern politicians on record; alienating
for ever a steady support, in the
vain attempt to conciliate a contemptuous
and distrustful patronage!
If Lord John Russell were honest,
and Mr Cobden honest, and both firm,
what would be the inference?</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, when the late members of the
House of Commons were reduced to
the rank of private citizens, they had
belonged to various sects and parties,
as the representatives of opinions not
over easy to define and distinguish
for practical electioneering purposes.
There were fervent and lukewarm
Conservatives, with corresponding
Liberals; high church, low church,
dissenters, Protestants, Roman Catholics,
both in reality, and <em>in name</em>
only. All these were now to present
themselves to the country as worthy
of its confidence, a considerable majority
of them, however, being unable
to state what public man they owned
as leader, or to what party they professedly
attached themselves. And
many, indeed, wished themselves to
be thenceforth regarded as leaders and
founders of parties! And each individual’s
ambition would suggest to
him the necessity of considering how
he intended hereafter, if elected into
Parliament, practically to carry out
his views, with reference to a sphere
of action where unfortunately <em>all</em> could
not be leaders. How, then, were all
these to “go to the country?” And
that country, too, a somewhat shrewd
one!</p>

<p class='c008'>The last Session of the Parliament
of 1852 closed very quietly. Neither
Lord Derby in the House of Lords,
nor any of his colleagues or friends in
the House of Commons, seized an
opportunity for making, as with their
power they could have made, a
dazzling <i><span lang="la">ad captandum</span></i> appeal to the
country. Very many of their supporters
expected that this would have
been done; but we are of opinion
that, in not doing so, they acted
with a dignity and self-reliance entitling
them to the highest respect.
They might, indeed, have pointed
to a glittering catalogue of their
doings during the Session—afforded
their supporters many rallying points,
and secured among them a conspicuous
consistency of means and
objects; but these advantages appeared
to be deliberately foregone. Never
before, in our memory, did a Ministry,
especially one so critically situated,
and professedly on its trial, go to the
country with less apparent effort to
secure a favourable verdict. It
amounted to an apparently indolent
over-confidence, susceptible of being
resolved by their enemies into a
conscious unworthiness, and distrust
alike of themselves, of their cause,
and of the issue.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl of Derby having distinctly
announced, in the month of February,
that he should be guided by the legitimately
expressed voice of the country,
in reimposing, or abstaining from
reimposing, duties on corn; and, moreover,
that he would not attempt to do
so, unless the country should decide
in favour of such a policy by an unequivocal
and even a great majority,
some two months afterwards made
another announcement, in answer to
one of the many interpellations with
which he was perseveringly harassed
by his opponents in the House of
Lords. He said that, if it would afford
them any satisfaction, he already distinctly
saw that the voice of the country
would be pronounced against the
reimposition of duties on corn, whether
for purposes of protection or revenue.
Forthwith there arose a cry among
his opponents and their advocates,
“Then at once retire, as avowedly
vanquished Protectionists!” and nothing
could exceed the rancorous reiteration
of the demand. Lord Derby,
however, remained unmoved; and his
enemies, beginning to fear that they
had to deal with one of thoroughly settled
purpose, anxiously cast about for
other topics of disparagement against
the coming elections. The public themselves,
however, seemed so provokingly
indifferent to their efforts, that
it was deemed unsafe to attempt an
open organisation of opposition, or to
inaugurate it by formal appeals to the
country, in the shape of public meetings.
Not one was called throughout
the length and breadth of the land!
although it was occasionally whispered
that a great staff of agitators
at Manchester, amply officered, and
largely supplied with the sinews of
war, were ready to start into action at
a moment’s notice. But in defence
of what? Lord Derby had already declared
that the corn laws were out of
his reach, and his supporters were
almost everywhere using the same
language; many of them accompanying
it, however, with avowals that
their <em>opinions</em> were unchanged, though
the temper of the masses of society
rendered it impossible to act up to
those opinions. Then—said his enemies—is
not this monstrous? The
cause of Free Trade is now in the
keeping of false friends, or rather of
its enemies, who are only apparently
surrendering their opinions and intentions,
in order subtlely and indirectly
to effectuate them by and by! and
there arose the cry that this was to
be done by the juggle of readjusting
taxation. On this point the Ministers
and their friends avowed that
they were concentrating their attention
with a view to redress glaring
injustice; but beyond that general declaration
they could be induced to say
nothing. In the mean time, the nation
began to speak out for itself
unequivocally on another great subject
of its anxiety—the safety of our
Protestant institutions, threatened by
Dr Wiseman and his allies in Ireland,
in a spirit of deadly hatred
and unwavering resolution. They did
not condescend to conceal or disguise
their intention of securing a large
accession of force in the new House
of Commons—a course of procedure,
however, calculated directly to
strengthen the hands of the Government,
who were at all events known
to be thoroughly in earnest upon the
subject of Protestantism. Concurrently
with this, there existed another
subject of anxiety among moderate
men of all parties—the sweeping
changes, of a democratic tendency,
proposed by Lord John Russell and
his new friends to be effected in our
political institutions. The Earl of
Derby took several opportunities of
declaring publicly and unequivocally
his determination to resist all attempts
of this kind, come in whatever shape,
and from whatever quarter, they
might; and the practical result of all
this was, that he stood, on the eve
of the all-important appeal to the
country, in the character of a <span class='sc'>Protestant
Conservative Minister</span>.
That appeal, it was declared by his
opponents, would at once annihilate
him and his Government. But the
assertion was always accompanied
by a certain small difficulty in suggesting
who was to succeed him,
and what was the exact combination
of parties by which that successor
was to be made, and to be kept,
Minister. At all events, it was said,
get rid of Lord Derby. Strip off his
disguises, and expose him and his
friends to the country as charlatans
and impostors; and, when the proper
time comes, it will be sure to find the
proper man. The organs of the Peel
party began now to make themselves
heard a little; we were told that that
was the quarter in which the coming
man was to be looked for; and it was
whispered at Clubs, and intimated
in the papers, that the Duke of
Newcastle had the list of his Cabinet
complete!—Thus, then, stood matters
when the writs were delivered into
the hands of the returning officers
throughout the kingdom; and when
the vital struggle commenced, the
attitude of Ministers was at once
firm and modest.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <cite>Times</cite> of Wednesday the 7th
July thus announced, in its leading
article, the commencement of the
grand struggle:—“So far as regards
the disputed seats, the general election
begins this morning, and a few
hours will place beyond doubt our
probable masters for the next five
or six years”—words very exciting
to all ardent politicians, and fraught
with no little truth. That the editor,
when he wrote them, expected the
result to be a defeat of Ministers, no
one who has read what had been said
before, and has been said subsequently,
and with increasing bitterness,
in the eloquent leading columns of
the <cite>Times</cite>, can doubt. The first week
was devoted to the English borough
elections; and here the opponents of
the Government expected a long series
of triumphs. It is not consistent
with our space or purpose to present
a detailed retrospect of the general
elections. We shall content ourselves
with indicating a few salient
points, fraught with <em>great political
significance</em> in respect of both persons
and places—the sayings and doings
of the chief electors and elected.</p>

<p class='c008'>A calm voice from Calne first
caught the attentive ear. The Earl
of Shelburne, the son and heir of the
Marquis of Lansdowne, was re-elected
without opposition on Tuesday
the 6th July. What said he, on
returning thanks for his re-election?
That he had “thought it desirable to
try the experiment of Free Trade;
saw nothing to shake his faith in it—much
to confirm it; but had
always thought that the change had
been very abrupt. There were persons
who had been seriously affected
by the rapidity of the change, and he
should therefore be ready to give his
attention to any proposed remedy for
their distress.” “He was not a supporter
of the present Government,
but should offer no factious opposition
to them; and although there
were other men quite competent to
conduct the government of the country,
to whom he could more readily
give assistance, yet, until those men
were established in power, he by no
means said, that if the present Government
brought forward measures
of which he could approve, he would
not give them his support. He felt
that it was his duty, as their representative,
to abstain from all factious
opposition to the present Government,
until some other Government
became possible.” If the Earl of
Derby had been one of Lord Shelburne’s
auditors, he ought to have
been perfectly satisfied with these
declarations; yet the speaker has
been ever since set down in the daily
lists given, in both the Conservative
and Liberal newspapers, amongst the
opponents of the Government, as
though he were one of those certain of
being found among the “ayes” on that
“want of confidence” motion which
a whisper from Sheffield was at the
same time telling us would be the first
step taken by the triumphant Liberal
majority in the new Parliament.
Weighing the political considerations
likely to sway such a man as Lord
Shelburne, can it be doubted that his
tendencies are Conservative, though
moderate, and that his public utterance
of his sentiments was designed
to be regarded as timely and significant?
Lord Shelburne was in the
late Parliament, and consequently
aware of all that had been said by,
on behalf of, and against Ministers;
and he was also, when he thus spoke,
aware of what would be the consequence
of an instant, blind, unscrupulous
act of opposition—one shameful
in itself, as factious, and calculated
to be attended by consequences most
serious to the State. He therefore
gave public notice that those inclined
to act thus are to look for no countenance
from him. Thus much for
what fell from the Earl of Shelburne,
and which, as in full accordance with
the temperate, dignified, and friendly
course adopted by his noble father in
the House of Lords, since the accession
of Lord Derby, is by no means
unworthy of attention. But the very
temperate tone of the member for
Calne has distinguished many others
of the re-elected or newly-elected
members for both boroughs and counties;
who have in express terms repudiated
factious opposition to the
Government, recognising the necessity
of carefully reconsidering our
fiscal policy, in consequence of the
suddenness with which the late
changes were effected, and the severe
sufferings they have entailed upon
particular classes. Yet all such members
duly take their places in the
aforesaid “lists”—gentlemen of fortune,
of position, of attainments, of
high personal character, with a large
stake in the welfare of the country—as
though they were “safe cards”
for an unscrupulous Opposition, and
always at the beck and bidding of
such statesmen as a Cobden or a
Bright! These are, indeed, fond but
fallacious calculations, as the result
will very shortly show.</p>

<p class='c008'>Turn we now to Tiverton, where,
on the ensuing day, (Wednesday the
7th July,) a very distinguished
person was re-elected for Parliament—we
mean <span class='sc'>Lord Palmerston</span>.
The noble lord declared his political
opinions in considerable detail; and
no one can read what fell from him
without admiring the fascinating ease
and playfulness which adorned the
manifestation of intellectual power
and great political knowledge. <em>Not
one syllable</em> was uttered by Lord
Palmerston of a hostile, disparaging,
or offensive character, with reference
to Lord Derby or his Government.
He did not stoop to borrow those
vulgar and degrading terms of opprobrium
in which so many of his co-aspirants
for political power suffered
themselves to indulge, thereby disentitling
themselves to the consideration
of gentlemen. He undoubtedly
spoke of Protection as “a
question long since settled,” admitting
that he himself had been in
favour of such “a small duty as
would not have raised in any perceptible
degree the price of food, but
which would never be again submitted
to the choice of the agriculturists.”
He deprecated hasty reforms, earnestly
advocating “steady progressive
improvement of our institutions,
going slowly and deliberately about
them,” and deprecating “rashly and
hastily overturning those ancient institutions
under which this country
has long flourished and prospered.”
He utterly repudiated vote by ballot
and triennial Parliaments, justified
his support of the ministerial Militia
Bill, and spoke with extreme caution
on the subject of the Maynooth grant.
He made no allusion to any political
leaders, nor indicated any possible
situation or combination of parties in
the new Parliament, nor what was the
course which he himself might feel
bound or disposed to pursue. Thus
much for this eminent person, who
said nothing which might not also
have been said by any even <em>decided</em>
supporter of the Ministry. The indignity
which had been inflicted upon
himself by Lord Derby’s predecessor,
he passed over in dignified silence.
Lord Palmerston, again, is claimed
by the Liberal journals as an undoubted
opponent of the Ministry,
whatever measures they may or may
not propose!</p>

<p class='c008'>On the ensuing day <span class='sc'>Lord John
Russell</span> was declared re-elected, after
a suddenly-announced contest. He said
that he relied on his past career as the
best guarantee of his probable future
career; spoke of the question of Free
Trade as finally disposed of; and added,
that “that contest being removed
out of the way, questions of religious
liberty—of Parliamentary reform—reform
of our courts of law and equity—of
sanitary reform—and others of
vast and deep importance to the people
at large, will have due attention
bestowed upon them, and time given
for their consideration.” When challenged
on the subject of Papal Aggression,
he answered coldly and drily,
in a single sentence—“I never will
allow any interference with the supremacy
and independence of the Crown
and of the nation; but, on the other
hand, I will never punish any man
for his religious opinions.” Into this
shrivelled sentence had shrunk the
lusty letter to the Bishop of Durham!
He declared himself determined to
remove “all religious disabilities,”
especially those alleged to affect the
Jews; and that “one simple oath,
the same for persons of <em>all religious
faiths</em>,” should be substituted for the
existing oaths—of course including
every class of heathens and pagans!
He declared himself opposed to vote
by ballot; and when pressed on the
subject of extending the franchise
and shortening the duration of Parliament,
spoke with marked guardedness,
thus:—“With regard to these
two questions, I must ask the indulgence
of the electors. With regard
to any measure I may bring forward,
or may support, in Parliament, I have
to consider, first, what is best for the
country; and next, what other men
will support, and what I have a chance
of carrying. If fit to be your representative,
I am fit to be intrusted
with discretion on those subjects.” It
is worthy of notice, that whereas Lord
John Russell, in 1847, had 7137 votes,
he polled in 1852 only 5537 votes—<em>i. e.</em>,
1660 votes fewer than in 1847;
while Mr Masterman was returned at
the head of the poll by 6195 votes—<em>i. e.</em>,
a majority of 658 votes over
Lord John Russell—Mr Rothschild
having gravitated to the bottom of
the poll, where he lay pressed down
by a majority over him, by Sir James
Duke, of 522 votes. In 1847, Mr
Rothschild had 6792—in 1852, only
4748 votes. All these are highly significant
facts, not to be accounted for
by the mere suddenness of the struggle.
In noticing these facts, and also
recording the triumphant return, at
the head of the poll, of the Government
candidate at Greenwich, the
<cite>Times</cite> observed—“Thus far the
changes, such as they are, are in
favour of Lord Derby.” On that
day, however, the <cite>Times</cite> had unexpectedly
to record, in letters of mourning,
a very splendid triumph for Lord
Derby, in the result of a contest on
which, as if by common consent, the
eyes of the whole kingdom had for
many weeks been fixed with intense
anxiety. It was the deliberately-selected
battle-field between the Earl
of Derby and his combined Peelite
and ultra-liberal opponents. This
was, indeed, a pitched battle between
parties; and the field was Liverpool.
Lord Derby sent one of his own lieutenants
to fight it, and in conjunction
with an eminent, and very able, and
highly-respected resident supporter
at Liverpool; the opponents being an
equally honourable Liverpool resident,
and Mr Cardwell, the late member,
and favourite lieutenant of the late Sir
Robert Peel. All parties admitted that
the issue of this contest, especially if of
a decisive character, would be of immense
political importance; and the
general impression undoubtedly was,
that the Ministerial candidates had undertaken
too much for their strength.
All other elections were thrown into
the shade while this was pending; the
result of which was conveyed hourly to
London, during the London election,
by the electric telegraph. The result
dismayed our opponents. Lord
Derby’s candidate headed Mr Cardwell
by 1130 votes, and his other
opponent by 1467 votes; while the
other Ministerial candidate, Mr Turner,
headed Mr Cardwell by 1446
votes, and Mr Cardwell’s comrade by
1783 votes! Such was the decision deliberately
pronounced by the great and
enlightened constituency of Liverpool;
and it has been, and will be, attended
by consequences of magnitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Cardwell’s defeat at Liverpool
has been followed by the signal discomfiture
of that small party in the
late House of Commons, of which he
had been a distinguished member—Mr
Green, Mr Smythe, Mr Roundell
Palmer, (an amiable and most accomplished
man, who, after an arduous
canvass, fled without a struggle,) Mr
Pusey, Mr Townley, Mr Tollemache,
Mr Mackinnon, Lord Mahon, Lord
Norreys, Sir C. Douglas, Sir George
Clerk, and others—as though there
had been a sort of political murrain
among them; and the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>
has had to gnash its little teeth,
day after day, in despair, as its friends
disappeared; declaring, at length,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> in
a solemn, funereal strain—“A competent
Ministry might be formed from
the candidates who, at the present
election, have been rejected principally
in consequence of their political
honesty and intellectual superiority!”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the same day on which Lord
John Russell expounded his political
opinions, on having been declared
re-elected for London, Sir James
Graham presented himself to the constituency
of Carlisle, and made a very
remarkable appearance. At that period
not a few regarded him as most
likely to be fixed upon as the leader
of the combined forces of the Opposition—and,
on defeating Lord Derby—as
his successor; and what might
fall from him on the present occasion
was regarded with some curiosity.
Respect for the private personal character
of the right honourable baronet
would incline one to speak with forbearance
of his chequered and erratic
public career; but it must be owned
that he has by turns belonged to,
aided, and damaged, almost every
party in the State—adopting and
abandoning political principles, whenever
a candidate for office, with a levity
that is lamentable to all interested in
the public character of statesmen.
His habit of replying with a sort of
jaunty jocularity, to taunts on the
score of his having boxed the political
compass, tells heavily against him in
the estimation of a sincere and staid
people like ourselves, especially when
he himself comes forward, at the
eleventh hour, to level elaborate sarcasms
at those whom he may deem
obnoxious to similar imputations.
He has of late been peculiarly bitter
in his reproaches against the present
Ministers, on the subject of their imputed
inconsistencies on the subject
of Protection. If Sir James were to
cast his eyes over pp. 669–695, of the
46th volume of Hansard,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> where
stands recorded a lengthened, elaborate,
and most able speech of his, in
opposition to Mr Villiers’ motion to
consider the question of repealing the
corn laws, we cannot but think that
it would, for a moment, bring the
colour into his cheek, and make him
indeed doubtful as to his political,
if not even personal, identity. He
is there seen sternly vindicating the
landlords against false imputations of
cowardice and selfishness. “If the
advocates of Free Trade expected
them to yield to fear, he mistook
their character greatly, if he could not
confidently pronounce, that from such
motives as these they ought not, so
they never would act;” and he reprobated
agitation on the subject of
the corn laws, as productive of disastrous
consequences. “Commerce,
credit, floating capital, were exotics
which flourished in the sunshine of
national tranquillity; and if a struggle,
such as was contemplated on the
other side, were pushed to extremities,
the very manufactures which
they sought to encourage would take
to themselves wings, and fly away to
lands where they might hope that
national peace would be preserved,
and life and society be secured.” He
heard “with astonishment, the President
of the Board of Trade declare
that he had encouraged agitation; a
declaration well worthy of the member
for Manchester, but utterly unworthy
of a Minister of the Crown.”
“If they endeavoured by force of law
to establish, that in a year of comparative
scarcity the home-corn grower
should not have a price which would
cover the cost of production, they
aimed a deadly blow at British native
agriculture, which, after all, depend
upon it, was the foundation of national
power and prosperity, and the
mainstay of national greatness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The peroration of his speech consisted
of a touching and beautiful
picture of the corn lands of this country
thrown out of cultivation, and
agricultural labour superseded. “After
the best reflection which he could
bestow upon the subject [!] and viewing
it in every possible light [!] he did
not hesitate to declare his conviction,
that a free importation of corn must
produce the same effect in England
that the law of agistment had produced
in Ireland.... Let
them but once diminish the consumption
of British-grown corn, and from
that moment the consumption of iron,
of hardware, of cotton, and of woollens
must decline. Then would
come a fresh displacement of labour,
and a fresh lowering of wages; and
discontent, disturbance, and misery
would prove its inevitable consequences....
Little could
they estimate the wretchedness which
sprung from change of habit, of house,
of manners, of the mode of life itself.
What change more cruel could despotism
itself inflict, than a change
from ‘the breezy call of incense-breathing
morn,’ to a painful and
grievous obedience to the sad sound
of the factory bell—the relinquishment
of the thatched cottage, the blooming
garden, and the village green, for the
foul garret or the dark cellar of the
crowded city—the enjoyment of the
rural walk of the innocent rustic Sabbath,
for the debauchery, the temptations,
the pestilence, the sorrows, and
the sins of a congregated multitude?
Where were their moralists, that their
voices were not raised against the
fearful consequences which the proposed
change brought in its train?
Talk to him of sending the Poles to
Siberia, or the hill coolies from the
Coromandel to the Mauritius! the
authors of the intended change contemplated
the perpetration, within
the limits of their native land, of a
cruelty far more atrocious. It was
the first step towards making England,
the workshop of the world, dependent
for its daily food upon Continental
supplies. He hoped that the
proposition would not be successful.
Were it to succeed, he should say
with his friend Lord Ashburton, that
<em>this was the last country which he
should wish to inhabit</em>.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> And for
these reasons he concluded by “not
hesitating to give his cordial
and decided opposition to the
motion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Was this the Sir James Graham
who, only thirteen years afterwards,
could venture to scatter sarcasms over
the Earl of Derby and his supporters?</p>

<p class='c008'>When Sir James presented himself,
shortly after the accession of the present
Government, before his present
constituents, he declared himself a
convert, at length, to vote by ballot;
or, at all events, as in a situation to
become an immediate convert! Both
in and out of the House, he has ever
since been one of the most sedulous
and skilful of those who have striven
to lower the Government and their
friends in the estimation of the country,
timing his appearance with great
exactness, so as to seize the moment
for most effective action; striving to
disguise his earnestness and anxiety
beneath the mask of a jocular contempt,
but ever studiously keeping himself in
the foreground. When before the
constituency of Carlisle on the 8th of
July, he appeared to feel the necessity
of diverting attention from the
political wanderings of his whole life,
by taking the lion’s share of credit for
almost all the great measures of modern
times. He had, however, transparently
another object—to paint his
own portraiture upon the eyes of the
country, as <span class='fss'>THE</span> practical statesman
of the age, of enlightened sagacity and
extended experience, with both the
will and the power to do whatever
might be expected of one aspiring to
lead the motley throng combined
against Lord Derby. We suspect, however,
that the portrait, though finished
off by the sitter’s own masterly hand,
with a loving warmth of colouring,
has only been eyed askance by those
whom it had been intended to charm;
while the <cite>Times</cite> criticised it severely.
“After perambulating England,” said
Sir James, “I have come home at
last, and once more appear before the
Carlisle constituency. I have no personal
object to gratify. I see a great
public interest at stake; and I think
it of the last importance that this
capital of the Borders should send no
doubtful voice to the approaching
Parliament.... If the electors of
this city shall be of opinion that the
time has arrived when, with reference
to the public interest, I should withdraw
from the public service, I will
respectfully retire. If, on the other
hand, they be of opinion that my labour
may still be useful to the public,
<em>I am content, for a short time longer</em>,
to give to the <em>public my best exertions</em>.
I cannot promise you that they will
be more zealous, more energetic <em>than
they have been</em>; nor am I vain enough
to expect that my exertions can be
attended with greater success than
has crowned my past efforts.” We
regard this as neat, and unequalled.
Such a cool bidding for power was probably
never before made by a man of
Sir James Graham’s mark in this
country.—A certain Dr Lonsdale then
assumed the functions of catechist of
Sir James Graham, whose ears he
first soothed with the dulcet assurance
that “Sir James Graham was
sure to hold the highest place in the
next Administration!” and the venerable
catechumen answered the courteous
catechist very smoothly on the
subject of foreign politics; but the latter
concluded by saying—“The right
honourable gentleman has shown that
he is neither a Derby-<em>ite</em> nor a Russell-<em>ite</em>.
Then what <em>ite</em> are you?” Sir
James replied, “It is true I am not a
Derby-ite, nor a Russell-ite: Dr
Lonsdale asks what ‘ite’ I now am.
I <em>have</em> been a Peelite; but am
now resolved not to bind myself
in the fetters of any party, but will
do my best as a private member
of Parliament, <span class='sc'>or in any situation
which it may be in the pleasure
of the Crown to call upon me to
fill</span>.” We ask again, when was
this equalled? Had Sir James and
the Doctor arranged this little scene
beforehand? Sir James said not a
word, having been kindly not asked a
word, on the subject uppermost in the
mind of the country—the insolent and
dangerous machinations of Popery
against our civil and religious liberties;
but on the subject of Reform, he declared
stoutly that he had been dissatisfied
“with the new Reform Bill
introduced by the late Whig Government;”
that the Reform Act of 1832
(for which he claimed a large share of
credit) “was marked by great imperfections,”
and “a revision of the measure
was indispensable.” The new
Reform Bill ought “to disfranchise
decayed boroughs, and extend the
franchise to large communities not at
present enjoying it.” And, “with respect
to cities and boroughs, it appeared
to him that residence and
rating should be the legitimate foundation
of any future extension of the
suffrage.” Sir James then bade high
for popular favour; but, as we showed
in our April number,<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> he is necessarily
opposed, in his attempts to unsettle
the Reform Act, to some of the
greatest Whig supporters of the late
Government; one of whom, Earl Fitzwilliam,
declared in his place in Parliament,
since the accession of Lord
Derby, his strong disapproval of Lord
John Russell’s recent Reform Bill—adding,
“It will not do for the Government
to be thus continually tampering
with constitutional rights.”
As the English borough elections
went on, notwithstanding the Ministers
succeeded in a great number of instances
in which they attacked Liberal
seats, they appeared to have suffered
no inconsiderable losses; but they displaced
numerous staunch and able supporters
of the late Government, as well
as several of the Radical members.
One of the Liberal papers (the <cite>Daily
News</cite>) of the day on which we are
writing, following the tristful example
of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> in respect
of its Peelite friends, mourns
over the following victims:—Mr
Bernal, Mr Greene, Mr Horsman,
Sir Edward Buxton, Mr Hardcastle,
Lord Ebrington, Lord Duncan, Mr
W. J. Fox, Mr Anstey, Sir John
Romilly, Sir William Somerville,
Colonel Thompson, Mr D’Eyncourt,
Mr George Thompson—to which he
might have added a long catalogue of
others; and may now greatly increase
the list—Sir George Grey being a host
in himself! and thus concludes: “Still,
even with these losses, our ranks are
crowded; and we shall give Lord
Derby battle, with no fear as to
where will be the victory.” This,
however, was said on the 21st July,
after the ranks of Lord Derby had
been swollen with reinforcements from
the English counties and from Ireland,
without, at the same time, losing
ground in Scotland. So long as
the English borough returns, which
came in almost all at once, or within
two or three days of each other,
showed a considerable numerical superiority
for the opponents of Lord
Derby, notwithstanding his gains, the
Liberal papers, as if agreeing to close
their eyes against the distant but inevitable
<em>county</em> returns! were loud in their
exultations, occasionally slipping into
even truculent expressions. “Thus
ends,” says one, “somewhat prematurely
too, the farce of a Derby
Ministry.” “Will Lord Derby venture
to meet the new Parliament?”
asked another. “The Derbyites begin
now to feel the absurd appearance
they make before the country which
they have so long striven in vain to
mystify and amuse.” “How do you like
the returns, my Lord Derby?”—And
so forth.  On the other hand, the
friends of the Ministry began also to
quake, and go about with downcast
looks, uttering despondency; and one
of their own ablest organs was forced
to “remind its friends that they were
not to run away disheartened by the
idea that they had <em>suffered a loss</em> on
every occasion on which they had
simply failed to wrest a seat from their
opponents;” and its readers were
assured “that, all things considered,
matters wore by no means an unpromising
aspect.” Another able journal
concluded by the solemn assurance,
that, “great as were Lord Derby’s
difficulties, those of the leaders, whoever
they might be, of the heterogeneous
opposition, were at least as
great”—a passage quoted the next day
by a triumphant Liberal contemporary,
with the words “cold comfort!” prefixed.
A week’s time, however, began
to tell startling tidings for the
opponents of the Ministry.  Unexpected
success in Ireland, notwithstanding
almost unprecedented difficulties
and obstacles arising out of
the demoniacal conduct of the Papal
emissaries, to whom we shall presently
again allude; and the counties,
pouring in their contingents by threes
and twos at a time, soon gave a
totally different aspect to the field of
battle. In almost every instance,
moreover, where Lord Derby’s county
friends were assailed, they triumphantly
maintained their ground;
and in nearly every case where they
were assailants, they were successful.
It was amusing to note how suddenly
Lord Derby’s opponents in the press
drew in their horns; and after the
“boldest” had “held their breath for
a time,” they began to comfort one
another by fearful tales of intimidation;
of divers gross irregularities
pervading the whole proceedings; of
divisions among the Liberal party,
letting in the common enemy; the
defective state of the registries; and
the still more defective and unsatisfactory
condition of the franchise!</p>

<p class='c008'>Having, however, heard what Lord
Shelburne, Lord John Russell, Lord
Palmerston, and Sir James Graham
thought proper to address, concerning
their opinions and purposes, to their
respective constituencies, let us hasten
on to a very eager, bustling, and ambitious
personage, making his appearance
much later in the field as a candidate
for re-election for a county—we
mean Mr Richard Cobden; who, on
Saturday the 17th July, presented
himself on the hustings at Wakefield,
to go through the pleasant ceremony
of an unopposed re-election. He was
accompanied by—<em>Sir Charles Wood</em>,
Lord John Russell’s late Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and then chairman
of Mr Cobden’s committee, of which
he had taken pains to show himself a
conspicuous and active member.
Several points of the former gentleman’s
appearance on this occasion
challenge  particular  observation;
chiefly as indicative of his intense
vanity and egotism; his virulent
hatred of the Ministerial party, especially
of the brilliant Chancellor of
the Exchequer, under whose knout he
had so frequently writhed; his absorbed
one-ideadness; his consciousness
of the palsied condition of the
“Liberal” party, and the necessity of
powerful stimulants to revive it; and
the absence of any, even the slightest
indication of triumph at the state of
the elections. Before the electors, at
the hustings, he was content to appear
in his capacity as a Free-Trader
only, reserving the other more special
matters for a subsequent occasion,
when sure of a safe and favourable
reception from his own supporters
only, under the auspices of Sir Charles
Wood. On the former occasion he deliberately
glorified himself on account of
“his name being so prominently connected
with Free Trade,” and “having
the honour, privilege, and glory to see
himself individualising, as it were, a
great and permanent principle!” He
proceeded to charge the Ministerial
party with “undisguised selfishness
in advocating a change of taxation
for the benefit of particular interests;”
“transferring the taxation now paid
by the land, to the shoulders of those
who have no land at all”—which was
“protection in a new form, ten
thousand times less tenable than in
its former aspect.” He hoped “that
forty-eight hours would not elapse
after the meeting of Parliament before
the present Government, and the
party that belongs to it, are brought
fairly to issue upon the question of
Free Trade or Protection.” This sort
of worn-out dreary drivel was all that
he thought it prudent to say upon the
hustings before the electors of the West
Riding; but it was far otherwise afterwards,
at the “luncheon” at the Corn
Exchange, presided over by Sir Charles
Wood, and given to Mr Cobden by
his “friends and supporters.” He
there ventured to launch out into
general politics; “and as Parliament
was likely to meet in November,” he
said it “would be as well to calculate
beforehand what the state of parties
would be.” He immediately
betrayed his fears of returning to
the condition of a political cipher, in
the absence of Free Trade agitation.
“The subject of Free Trade being
disposed of, the state of parties would
be found exceedingly embarrassing
to the old political leaders! The
House would not answer the helm;
and the question was, how they
should take a new tack!”—“I do
not think there is anything in the
temper of the country which should
precipitate any decision on the point”—he
had seen the then rapidly-altered
aspect of the election returns!—“for
with the exception of the feeling
as regards [<em>sic</em>] Free Trade, I do
not think there is much political feeling
in the country on any question!
There will be, in the House of Commons,
no party so strong as to be
able to form a Government which can
be bargained [!] to stand for three
months, if the old rule is to be acted
on as to Government majorities.
The question then is, <em>how are parties
to be reconstituted</em>? Consequently
our friends of the statesman and
functionary class must take counsel
to themselves, and <span class='sc'>see what is to
be done in order to inspire some
fresh enthusiasm, by and by, in
the country, on behalf of the
old Liberal party</span>!” This was the
same gentleman who, on attempting
to reorganise the League, upon Lord
Derby’s accession to power, unwittingly
acknowledged, in terms, the
extreme difficulty of “keeping up the
excitement of the people, on the subject
of <em>Free Trade</em>, for more than a
few weeks!” Mr Cobden then favoured
his company with a few of
his luminous notions on the subject
of “Parliamentary Reform;” being
pleased to intimate that “as far
as the suffrage was concerned, Lord
John Russell had proposed a five-pound
rating claim;” but Mr Cobden
“would rather have a five-pound
renting clause—a franchise
which would go, he thought, almost
as far as any gentleman in that
room practically expected or probably
wished—<em>at present</em>.” Mr Cobden
concluded with coarse and insolent
invective against the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. “If there is a
man in this country—a politician who
has suddenly jumped to an elevation
which I predict he will not sustain—who
may be called a dangerous revolutionist,
if he have the opportunity—it
is he! The strangest revolution I
have seen, was when I found the great
territorial party declaring intellectual
bankruptcy and proclaiming political
suicide, by naming Mr Benjamin
Disraeli as their chief! And if it were
not for the steadying, ballasting principle
of the Manchester school, which
would prevent <em>jugglers, and mountebanks,
and unscrupulous incendiary
adventurers</em> from playing tricks in this
country, [!] there is no man so dangerous,
because none who seemed
less unwilling, at all times, to bend
anything like the profession of principle
to his own personal and sinister
objects, than the present Chancellor
of the Exchequer!”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Without condescending
to characterise the tone
and style of this attack upon an absent
gentleman, let us see how he was
being spoken of elsewhere, at the very
same moment, by a <em>gentleman</em>—one
of the most able, accomplished, and
high-minded members of the House
of Commons, Mr Drummond, the
member for West Surrey. “It appears
to me that our taxes have been
laid on upon no general principle, as
money was wanted, and that they
are not in the satisfactory state they
ought to be. Let the Minister be
who he may, this must be put in a
better state; and I believe that Mr
Disraeli is more likely, and the persons
now in office are more likely, to
do this than others.—I must be permitted
to say, that I think Mr Disraeli
a man of very great genius. He
has risen by his own merits alone;
and never having been tried in office,
he is not a man who ought to be
sneered at by persons who pretend
that they wish ‘to extend the basis
of the Administration!’” This dignified
rebuke might have been uttered
by the speaker on listening to Mr
Cobden’s gross vituperation on the
occasion to which we are referring.
Such was Mr Cobden—in Yorkshire;
such will not be Mr Cobden—in
the House of Commons, when
standing face to face before that
same formidable Chancellor of Exchequer,
behind whose back he has
spoken offensively with such virulent
vulgarity and presumption. Passing
over these smaller matters, however,
it is impossible not to note the
recently lowered tone of Mr Cobden,
whilom so loud and confident on the
subject of a “Protectionist Ministry”
as a thing to be only “laughed at,”
and which would “fly like chaff before
the wind before a General Election.”
On the ensuing day, the <cite>Times</cite>, in
commenting on Mr Cobden’s speech,
pronounced to be “not wholly worthy
of his theme”—and in a “tone
hardly elevated enough for the
occasion”—“recommended to the
consideration of the future Parliament
the advice of Mr Cobden with
reference to the manner in which
Ministers should be dealt with.”—“It
is only fair and wise to hear
from them the principles on which
they intend to act, and the measures
which they mean to bring forward....
By precipitating matters,
we are quite sure either to prevent
the Ministry from showing conclusively
the hollowness of their abandonment
of Free Trade, or from
bestowing upon us a great public
benefit. It is much easier to turn
out a Government than to form its
successor; and the besetting sin to
which heterogeneous Oppositions are
liable is, that they are apt to place
themselves in a situation in which
they may be called upon to act in
concert, when concert, except against
the common enemy, is impossible;
and thus, by the exertion of their
strength, to render their weakness
more apparent and more fatal.”
These were prudent counsels, and
probably influenced by the same
causes which had emboldened the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, a few
days previously,<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> thus to speak out
concerning the position and prospects
of the Government: “It is my firm
conviction that the Government of
Lord Derby will meet Parliament in
the autumn with an absolute majority.
To me that is not a subject of
doubt.” Two days afterwards—the
election returns, during the brief
interval, abundantly justifying him—Mr
Disraeli thus deliberately and
confidently addressed the constituency
of Buckinghamshire from the
hustings: “I express my firm and
solemn conviction, in the face of the
county of Buckingham, after witnessing
the present temper of the public
mind, and scanning—I am sure with
no prejudice—the results of the
general election, that the Ministry
will be permitted to bring forward
their measures; that no manœuvres
of faction will terminate their career;
and that those measures will obtain
the assent, and I will even say the
enthusiastic approbation, of the great
body of the people.” On the ensuing
day, the <cite>Spectator</cite> observed—“The
elections have not yet decided the
question of the majority; and it is
still possible that Lord Derby may
have the balance of numbers.” In
the “Postscript” to the same number
of his paper, the editor, in recounting
additional gains, observed—“Lord
Derby is steadily gaining in
the elections.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before these pages meet the reader’s
eye, all the elections will have
been completed; but up to the day
on which we are writing, it would
appear that nearly six hundred are
decided, and the results are thus classified
in the five morning papers of
this day.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> It is curious to see how
the various organs of political opinion
deal with the same facts, viewed
through the disturbing medium of
their own hopes and wishes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <cite>Times</cite> distinguishes between
“Ministerialists” and “Liberal Conservatives,”
giving 252 as the former,
and 63 as the latter—together, 315;
Liberals, 271;—placing the latter in
a minority of 44. The</p>

<p class='c008'>Doubtless all these are <em>intended</em> to
be, or to be deemed, fair approximations
towards the real numerical relations
existing between those who will
be found generally opposed to each
other in the House of Commons; but
it is obvious that such calculations are,
to a very great extent, purely conjectural,
and deeply tinctured by the
political predilections of those who
make them; and indeed it is impossible
for any calm and well-informed
observer to cast his eyes over the
columns on which these calculations
are based, without seeing abundant
reason for doubting the propriety of
even the Conservative classifications.
The gentlemen whose political
opinions and intentions are thus
confidently dealt with, must often
smile at the position thus assigned
to them. In the Liberal journals
of this day,<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> for instance, two members,
Mr Duncuft, for Oldham,
and Mr Sandars, for Wakefield, are
set down as “Non-Ministerialists,”
“Liberals,” and “Oppositionists;”
while, on the preceding day, Mr Duncuft
is reported as returning thanks
for the toast of “The Conservatives
of Lancashire;” and proposing “The
Conservative Press,” at a dinner given
by “The Conservatives of Wakefield,”
to Mr Sandars! And very many
other names might be mentioned,
which the slightest consideration must
show to be referred to the wrong category.
There are undoubtedly many,
and will be more, gentlemen returned
to Parliament, so far unpledged to particular
measures, and having indicated,
in such general terms, the tendency
of their political opinions, as to render
it doubtful on which side of the
Speaker’s chair they will sit, or on
which side they would vote on the
leading political questions of the day.
But we would warn those who have
been so loudly proclaiming their confident
opinions on the subject, to pause
before coming to a conclusion on the
course which will be adopted by the
majority, on the first fair and avowed
trial of strength between Ministers
and their opponents. In our opinion,
on a calculation of the probable
character of the members, upwards
of 70, yet unreturned—but all of
whose names are known, and their
general political opinions ascertained—whoever
shall propose a direct motion
of want of confidence in Ministers, or
any motion having that tendency,
will find himself in a very considerable,
if not, indeed, in a large minority.
The consequences of such a
successfully taken step, all must see,
would be exceedingly serious; and
a forced resignation under such circumstances
would greatly dissatisfy
the country, and still further confuse
the present perplexed party relations
of those opposed to the Government.
Long before Parliament meets, which
will be probably towards the close
of October, each member will have
asked himself frequently and anxiously
the grave question—Who
is to succeed Lord Derby? And
how is the compact and formidable
phalanx of his present supporters to
be practically dealt with? Without
such a sacrifice of principle as would
shock the morality of the whole
country, how could a Ministry be
formed which would combine in opposition
to the present occupants of
the Treasury Bench—those publicly
pledged persons who would insist on
being included in the new Government?
And by whom are they to be
led? What are the measures which
they would propose, and be likely to
carry? Will Lord Palmerston, Lord
John Russell, Sir James Graham, Mr
Gladstone, go into the same lobby
with Mr Hume, Mr Cobden, and Mr
Bright, on a motion in favour of a
great extension of the suffrage, vote
by ballot, triennial parliaments, or
the destruction of the Irish Church?—or
on a motion of simple want of
confidence in Ministers? And if Mr
Villiers, or any other member, should
propose a resolution expressive of
the determination of the House not
to sanction any measures calculated to
interfere with or reverse the policy of
the year 1846, who shall tell the fate of
it in the then existing complication and
character of the House of Commons,
with such various shades of opinion
on fiscal and economical questions?
Who shall expect a majority to agree
on what will constitute a prejudicial
or unjustifiable interference with that
policy? And suppose Ministers should
distinctly avow that it was not their
intention to propose measures directly
or indirectly aimed at such interference
or reversal? Suppose a considerable
number of members should be
found concurring generally in the Free
Trade policy, but also believing that
the manner in which it was introduced
and established was unjust, and injurious
to great interests in the country,
and anxious to repair such injustice,
and mitigate the admitted sufferings
of the agriculturists? This is the
opinion of Lord Shelburne, and doubtless
of many men of moderate opinions,
though formally opposed to the present
Government. Suppose, on the
other hand, the Minister, in answer
to such a motion, should be prepared
to intimate generally a policy likely
to be received with favour in the
House of Commons and out of doors;
and either move the previous question,
or boldly meet the motion with
a direct negative, and <em>successfully</em>?
Their hands would have been immensely
strengthened by their opponents,
for the remainder of the Session—perhaps
for many succeeding Sessions.
All these, and many other cognate
considerations, will be taken
calmly into account by the more astute
tacticians of the Liberal party; and,
in our opinion, shrewder counsels will
prevail than those which would herald
in an immediately aggressive policy
on the part of her Majesty’s motley
opposition. With the very best hostile
intentions, they would lack arms
and opportunity.  We concur in
every word of the following passage,
which fell from the lips of Mr Disraeli
at Aylesbury, so long ago as the 14th
instant. “We shall carry out our
views with more efficiency, and, I
believe, with more success, in the
new Parliament—when the Ministry
will no longer have to meet a hostile
Parliament, or be restrained in its
policy by an overpowering Opposition.
We shall meet Parliament prepared
to do our duty, under a firm conviction
that the country will steadily
support us. I will not conceive the
alternative position of the Government’s
failing to succeed; but at the
same time, no one can be blind to
the fact, that the Opposition will
create its organisation upon revolutionary
principles. The Whigs have
shown us their character. Their
policy has been received with universal
scouting by the country, and they
cannot attain to power again, except
by calling to their councils the Jacobin
clubs of Lancashire. I feel
that the present Government is necessary
for the preservation of the
English Constitution; but the future
institution of the Opposition already
peeps from its shell, and developes
its horns; and from that shell the
Opposition cannot emerge, except
enveloped in the slime of sedition. A
change in the institutions of the country
will be the condition of its success;
and Englishmen must indeed be false
to all their professions—false to that
high spirit which Englishmen have
ever shown—false to the traditionary
associations of their country, if
they suffer an Opposition, founded
on such principles, to govern this
nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you,” concluded the right
honourable gentleman, “be prepared
to say, we will have justice done to
the soil—we will have our legislation
conceived in the spirit of the age,
which is the spirit of justice? We
will have the <span class='sc'>Protestant Constitution</span>
of this country preserved, not
with the sectarianism of bigots, but
with those who believe that Protestantism
is the only safeguard of English
liberty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>In our opinion, the country has
answered these questions decidedly in
the affirmative, and thereby placed
firmly in power an able, united, Protestant
Conservative Government. It
is easy for newspapers, day after day,
and week after week, to repeat the
cuckoo cry that Ministers are impostors,
and that their policy is, in the
vulgar phraseology of the hour,
“<em>a sham</em>.” The progress and the
result of the general election of 1852
demonstrate that these paper pellets
cannot batter down the rock of national
firmness and good sense. Had
it been otherwise, Ministers must have
fallen ignominiously within the first
week of their presuming to take office;
for the wordy batteries of the “Liberal”
press have been blazing upon them,
double-shotted, from morning to night
ever since. Yet the Funds have never
gone down, and Ministers remain in
their places, not with downcast looks
and desponding hearts, but with
cheerful confidence and resolution,
satisfied that the voice of the nation
has pronounced in their favour, and has
also declared that it will regard their
acts with indulgence and forbearance,
and will not tolerate faction or intrigue.
There is now a fair prospect
that a united and powerful Government
may do incalculable good to
the country and the Sovereign which
has called that Government into
existence. Its mission is to act,
where its predecessor could only
talk; to consolidate and strengthen,
where that predecessor could only
disturb and unsettle; to terminate
the wretched strife of classes, by a just,
cautious, firm, and comprehensive
policy. Its mission is, further, to repel
the insolent advances of Democracy
and Popery, which will now
find that the day of vacillation and
vicious concession has passed away.
We say it with pain, that we believe
the interests of Protestantism are no
longer safe in the keeping of Lord
John Russell, though individually he
may be true at heart in his abhorrence
of the wicked and tyrannical
spirit of Popery; but his political
exigencies have fettered his will,
and chilled his spirit. His fondness
of power inclines him to compromises
and sacrifices, which very often look
only too like sacrifice of principle
and conviction. In like manner we
fear him in his dalliance with Democracy.
In tampering with the great
political adjustment of 1832, he is
seen standing irresolutely with his
foot upon the steep inclined plane
which leads to confusion and anarchy,
surrounded by those who are incessantly
goading and jogging him into
commencing the descent. We believe
that in his heart he despises the clique
of Cobden, Bright, &#38;c.; he has in fact
contemptuously told them so to their
very faces;<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> yet are we grievously
apprehensive that he is now prepared
to join them, faintly protesting, but
suffering them to impel him infinitely
further than he himself thinks it safe
or wise to go. That he has lost the
confidence of the country, few will
question; and is that confidence
now extended to Sir James Graham?
His recent career, especially his undisguised
sympathy with Popery,
would at once irritate and alarm the
country, if it saw his advent to
power a probable event; and, indeed,
he must have gazed with dismay on
the successive disappearance from
Parliament of so many of those to
whom he had recently allied himself,
in reliance on their efforts to consolidate
and work his influence. A very
few months, perhaps a few weeks,
will see the erratic baronet the close
ally of the Manchester School—at
once its leader and follower; he will
declare for a perilous extension of the
suffrage, and support it with powerful
and plausible arguments, but, at
the same time, with that semblance
of dignified candour and moderation,
which he has been latterly showing
such anxiety to assume, and acquire
credit for. He will co-operate with
Mr Cobden, very quietly at first, to
reorganise the Liberal party; and if
their efforts obtain any considerable
share of popularity, Sir James
will be seen one of the most eager
and swift in the race towards
the goal of revolution. Both he,
Mr Cobden, and Sir Charles Wood,
at present know well that they have
grievously lost ground in the country,
and that what they have so lost is
now in the possession of Lord Derby
and his Government.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of one thing we are <em>quite certain</em>,
that Ministers will not meet the
new Parliament unprepared to carry
into vigorous operation a well-considered
and determinate policy,
which will abundantly satisfy any
degree of reasonable expectation.
Nor shall we be surprised to see
them disposed to bring matters to a
speedy issue, if encountered by factious
opposition, come from what
quarter it may, and disguised under
never so specious an aspect. Those
interests which have suffered so
severely from precipitate legislation,
will be well represented in the new
House of Commons, and have to deal
with a friendly Ministry, which it
will be at once their interest and
their duty to support steadily, against
all hostile and sinister combinations.
The cause of law reform will be safe
in their hands; nay, the first four
months of their existence have shown
that it cannot be in better hands, and
we venture to deny that it can be in
any other hands so good as theirs.
They have indeed shown a thorough
heartiness in the sacred cause of law
and justice; and what they have
already done in this great department,
of itself is sufficient for ever
to signalise their hitherto brief tenure
of power. We shall not concern
ourselves, nor amuse our readers, by
speculations as to the precise number
of supporters with whom the election
returns are rapidly surrounding
Lord Derby and his Government.
It is now, as we have already stated,
upwards of a week ago since the
present Chancellor of the Exchequer
distinctly declared in public, that the
Government “would meet Parliament,
in the autumn, with an absolute
majority;” and we are not
aware of a single journal that has
ventured to contradict the statement.
Every day’s returns tend to corroborate
more and more strongly the truth
of that statement, which was one
calculated to challenge vehement
contradiction, could it have been
given consistently with fact. There
was a will, but no way, to do
so. Our own over-zealous friends
may have been too sanguine in
their expectations, and hasty in
their calculations; but those of our
opponents, at least of the more eager
and unscrupulous, are preposterous,
impeaching their good faith, or their
capacity as political observers. We
entertain no misgivings as to the
position and reception of Ministers in
the new Parliament. Their majority,
on vexed questions, may not be large,
but it will be sufficient; and against
faction, it will be <em>decisive</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>What, then, was the question
which has been put to the constituencies,
and answered? It was not
that of Free Trade or Protection.
The question was one of a far wider
description. Lord Derby, in February
last, stated in terms the
question which he sought to have
answered; a question not of details,
but of principles, relying on
the estimate formed of his character
by the country, for its allowing
him to carry these principles into
operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These are the <span class='fss'>PRINCIPLES</span> on
which I shall make my appeal on behalf
of myself and colleagues. We
are threatened with far more serious
difficulties than opposition to a five
shilling, six shilling, or seven shilling
duty on corn. It is a <span class='fss'>QUESTION</span>,
whether the Government of this
country can be carried on, and on
what principles, and through what
medium. Will you support a Government
which is against hostile attacks;
which will maintain the peace of the
world; which will uphold the Protestant
institutions of the country;
which will give strength and increased
power to religious and moral education
throughout the land; and which will
exert itself, moreover, I will not
hesitate to say, to oppose some barrier
against the current, continually
encroaching, of democratic influence,
which would throw power <em>nominally</em>
into the hands of the masses, practically
into those of the demagogues
who lead them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was, indeed, a <span class='sc'>Great Question</span>,
and it has been <span class='sc'>Answered</span>
satisfactorily to all lovers of constitutional
freedom.</p>

“Who is their Chancellor of the Exchequer? I’ll tell you what he is. He is a political
adventurer, who speculates on politics as a black-leg on the turn of the dice and the
fluctuating chance of the turf—a political trader!” And the refined and complimentary
Milesian proceeds to utter a supposed <em>bon-mot</em> concerning Mr Disraeli’s
